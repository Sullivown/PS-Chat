Our range of around 400 household brands \\nincludes Lipton, Knorr, Dove, Rexona, Hellmann’s and Omo. We are \\none of the largest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies globally. In 2018 we had 12 brands with turnover of over a billion euros or more. The strength of our global brands is reflected in Kantar’s Brand Footprint report published in May 2018. It found that 13 of the world’s top 50 FMCG brands – based on market penetration and consumer interactions – are owned by Unilever with these brands chosen 36 billion times each year. This is significantly more than any other FMCG company in the study. \\nOur portfolio also includes iconic local brands designed to meet the \\nspecific needs of consumers in their home market such as Brooke Bond in India and Brilhante in Brazil. We are increasingly seeing our local brands and innovations being rolled out to more markets such as Lakme and Breyers Delights. Our geographic reach gives us an unparalleled global presence, including a unique position in emerging markets which generate 58% of our turnover. \\nFrom the beginning of 2018, Unilever began operating across three \\nnew Divisions created as part of our efforts to accelerate shareholder value creation. The largest by turnover is Beauty & Personal Care followed by Foods & Refreshment then Home Care. Details of each can be found on pages 11 to 12. The sale of our spreads business was also completed in mid-2018. These changes create a strong platform to accelerate our strategy of long-term, sustainable shareholder value creation. Our strategy is explained in detail on page 10. \\nOur business activities span a complex global value chain which \\nis described on page 9. At the heart of our business is a workforce \\nof 155,000 people (as at 31 December 2018) who are driven by our \\npurpose and empowered to excel in our fast-changing markets. The \\ncombination of global scale and local agility has become yet more \\neffective through the continued implementation of our Connected 4 \\nGrowth (C4G) change programme to meet consumer trends which are \\ndetailed on page 8. Our employees are supported by leadership teams \\nwith representatives from over 70 countries. Of our business leaders, \\n80% are local to their markets reflecting the deep local expertise at \\nthe heart of our business. This rises to more than 90% when we include \\nmanagers who support those teams. \\nIn this volatile and uncertain world, protecting Unilever through the \\nfostering of business integrity is a non-negotiable for all employees. Our Code of Business Principles (the Code), and the 24 policies that support it (Code Policies), set out the behaviour standards required from all our people. The Code Policies cover a number of areas, including anti-bribery and corruption, respect, dignity and fair treatment of people and personal data and privacy. Together, the Code and Code Policies help us put our values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility and Pioneering into practice. See page 16 for more on our Code and Code Policies. \\nDuring the year the Boards withdrew proposals to simplify Unilever’s \\ndual-headed legal structure after extensive engagement with \\nshareholders. We remain firmly committed to our 2020 financial \\nprogramme and are confident of meeting its key targets and objectives \\nas our faster, simpler organisation delivers more efficiency, lower costs \\nand significant operational and financial benefits. \\nThis Annual Report and Accounts provides further detail on our \\nperformance during the year and how our business model is delivering \\nstrong returns for shareholders and a more sustainable way of doing', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Find out more about \\nour performance on pages 6 and 7. OUR PURPOSE \\nUNILEVER’S PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE LIVING \\nCOMMONPLACE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. \\nWe believe long-term sustainable growth is best delivered through \\nbrands that offer great performance and have a genuine purpose. \\nWashing shirts whiter or making hair healthier and shinier is still \\nvitally important, but product performance by itself is no longer enough. Consumers are looking for more. \\nAt Unilever, we encourage our brand managers to take a stance and \\nmake a positive difference to society. Purpose defines a brand in people's minds and is best delivered through action. It's only through action that consumers will see purpose as more than marketing. \\nOur company purpose ‘To make sustainable living commonplace’ \\nis unequivocal. We want to help create a world where everyone can live well within the natural limits of the planet. We put sustainable living at the heart of everything we do, including our brands and products, our standards of behaviour and our partnerships which drive transformational change across our value chain. \\nPurpose takes many forms amongst our brands. Some, like Lifebuoy, \\ntake on life-threatening diseases associated with poor hygiene with \\nprogrammes to change handwashing behaviour. Domestos' purpose \\nis to improve sanitation for millions of people who do not have access \\nto a toilet. Our brands can also be a catalyst to promote positive \\ncultural norms. Brooke Bond's purpose 'Common ground is only \\na cup away' is highly relevant in an increasingly divided world and \\ncan be applied well locally. In India, it addresses religious tensions. \\nIn the Gulf, divorce. In Canada, same-sex relationships. \\nSome of our brands take an activist stance, mobilising citizens to \\nchange policy or create social movements. For example, Ben & Jerry's builds movements around issues such as climate change and the refugee crisis. Seventh Generation – with its plant-based products – campaigns for renewable energy. Deodorant brand Rexona's purpose is to help reverse physical inactivity, a big issue for societies facing increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Rexona believes 'the more you move, the more you live' supported by Motion Sense technology which works through movement. Radiant believes everyone deserves an opportunity to shine. It goes beyond bright clothes and helping consumers 'dress to progress', enhancing skills through its Career Academies. Each market focuses on the skills that matter locally. In Brazil that's entrepreneurial and business skills. In India, English language skills. \\nAll of Unilever's brands are on a journey to becoming purposeful. \\nSustainable Living brands are those that are furthest ahead. In 2017, \\n26 of our brands qualified as Sustainable Living brands including our B-Corp certified brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Seventh Generation and Pukka Herbs, which means that they meet high standards of \\nsocial and environmental performance, transparency and legal \\naccountability. Our Sustainable Living brands grew 46% faster than the \\nrest of the business and delivered more than 70% of Unilever’s growth, \\ndriven by consumer demand for brands with purpose at their core. \\nHowever volatile and uncertain the world is, Unilever’s purpose – \\nsupported by the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and brands \\nwith purpose – will remain steadfast because managing for the \\nbenefit of multiple stakeholders is the best way for us to grow. \\nWe are now looking beyond the current USLP as many of our \\ntargets end in 2020.

       " Document(page_content=\"CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT \\n2018 PERFORMANCE \\nI am pleased to report that 2018 was another year of consistent top \\nand bottom line performance for Unilever. Solid revenue growth was combined with good profitability and cash flow delivery. This despite a challenging year for the global economy, with subdued growth and high levels of volatility undermining consumer confidence in many parts of the world. \\nUnilever is also operating in a sector that is experiencing widespread \\nchange and disruption. Although challenging, these changes offer \\nsignificant opportunities to companies able to move with speed and agility and who can tailor their offering to changing consumer preferences. To that end, the Boards are very confident that Unilever's strategy and the measures it has taken to strengthen its organisation, sharpen its portfolio and digitise its operations make it well placed to capture new and emerging growth opportunities. \\nThe Boards also believe that the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan \\ncontinues to set Unilever apart as a business highly attuned to the growing desire among consumers for companies and brands that serve a wider societal and environmental need. \\nIn 2018 we also completed successfully the complex disposal of the \\nspreads business. Our Share Buy-back programme delivered on \\nits intention to buy back shares with an aggregate market value of €6 billion, in line with Unilever's objective to return the after-tax proceeds of the spreads disposal to shareholders. \\nSIMPLIFICATION \\nFollowing a thorough review and widespread consultation, the Boards put forward proposals in 2018 to simplify Unilever’s dual-headed structure under a new single holding company. \\nIn developing the proposal – including a recommendation to \\nincorporate in the Netherlands while maintaining listings in the \\nNetherlands, the UK and the US – the Boards were motivated by the \\nopportunity to unlock value by simplifying Unilever and giving it added \\nflexibility to compete effectively over the longer-term. \\nWe recognised however that the proposal did not receive support \\nfrom a significant group of shareholders and therefore considered \\nit appropriate to withdraw. The Boards still believe that simplifying \\nUnilever’s dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and would serve Unilever’s best \\nlong-term interests. \\nSince withdrawing the proposal, I have met with a significant number \\nof PLC and NV shareholders to discuss further ideas and possible next \\nsteps. It is clear from all these meetings that there is widespread support for the principles and strategic rationale behind Simplification. In these \\nmeetings, I also took the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment \\nto further strengthen our corporate governance. Accordingly, in February 2019, we followed through on our commitment to cancel the \\nNV Preference Shares, in itself a major step towards simplifying the company’s share capital. \\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND SUCCESSION \\nThe 2018 AGMs marked the retirement of Ann Fudge as a Non-Executive Director and Vice-Chairman of the Boards. On behalf of the Boards, \\nI would like to thank Ann for her outstanding and valued contribution \\nto Unilever. \\nI was also delighted that you elected Andrea Jung as a Non-Executive \\nDirector at the same AGMs. Andrea brings highly relevant experience and expertise to Unilever and is a very welcome addition to the Boards. \\nCEO SUCCESSION \\nA key focus for the Boards last year was to manage the CEO succession, with Paul Polman stepping down as CEO after 10 years with the Group. \\nAfter a rigorous and wide-ranging selection process, the Boards were\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"After a rigorous and wide-ranging selection process, the Boards were \\nunanimous in its decision to appoint Alan Jope to the role. Alan became CEO on 1 January 2019 and is being proposed as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs. Alan has led Unilever's largest Division, Beauty & Personal Care, for the last four years and he has been a member of the Group's Leadership Executive since 2011. His previous roles include running Unilever’s business in North Asia. Alan has deep understanding and \\nwide experience of Unilever’s business and markets. He is a strong, \\ndynamic and values-driven leader with an impressive track record of \\ndelivering consistent high-quality performance across both developed and emerging markets. The Boards warmly welcome Alan to the role and look forward to working closely with him in the years ahead. \\nUnilever has been transformed under the leadership of Paul Polman. \\nHe has overseen ten years of consistent top and bottom line growth and very competitive returns to shareholders. He leaves with the \\ncompany’s geographic footprint and brand portfolio stronger and \\nwell positioned for future growth. \\nPaul’s pioneering commitment to sustainable and equitable growth have \\nmarked him – and the company – out as leaders in the field. Thanks to his visionary leadership and tireless efforts, Unilever is not only one of the most admired and respected companies in the world today, but also \\none of the most desired employers. \\nPaul retired as CEO and as a Board member on 31 December 2018. \\nHe will support the transition process in the first half of 2019 and \\nwill leave the Group in early July. We thank him for his remarkable contribution to the company and wish him every success in the future. \\nREMUNERATION \\nDuring 2018 we also continued to consult with shareholders on our Remuneration Policy, particularly for the Executive Directors. At the 2017 AGMs you provided your strong support to the implementation \\nof a reward framework that encourages and enhances a strong \\nperformance culture by enabling Unilever managers to have an even \\nstronger personal commitment to Unilever share ownership. \\nAt the 2018 AGMs, we asked shareholders to approve a new \\nRemuneration Policy that would align the pay of our Executive Directors fully with the Reward Framework we introduced following \\nthe 2017 AGMs. Whilst shareholders approved the new Remuneration \\nPolicy, we recognised that a significant minority of NV and PLC \\nshareholders voted against the proposal. On pages 50 and 51 of the 2018 Directors' Remuneration Report, we describe in detail the principal concerns and how we responded to them and other changes \\nto the implementation of the Remuneration Policy. \\nEVALUATION \\nFollowing the external Board evaluation in 2017, we used a simplified \\ninternal evaluation this year. While we concluded that the Boards continued to operate in an effective manner overall, the Boards decided that it will maintain a particular focus on portfolio and channel strategies and digitisation. Each Board Committee also performed its own self-evaluation, agreeing areas where it could enhance its effectiveness further. These are described within each Committee Report. \\nLOOKING AHEAD \\nEven though trading conditions are likely to remain challenging in 2019, the Boards remain confident both in the outlook and in the strategy for the Group, reflected by an 8% increase in the dividend for the 2018 financial year. \\nOver the year, Board members have visited Unilever operations in \\nseveral parts of the world, including China and the United States. We have seen first-hand the depth of talent that exists within the company, as well as the commitment of Unilever people to go on improving the lives of consumers and the societies in which the company operates.

       " Document(page_content='CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW \\nWidespread economic and geopolitical uncertainty meant that the \\nglobal business environment remained challenging in 2018. Currency depreciation in a number of key markets fuelled inflationary pressures and dampened consumer demand, while input costs rose steadily on the back of escalating commodity prices. \\nA SOLID PERFORMANCE \\nAgainst this backdrop, Unilever delivered a solid performance. \\nUnderlying sales grew by 3.1%, excluding the recently-divested spreads business (2.9% including spreads). Growth was profitable, \\nbringing our underlying operating margin to 18.4%, up 90 basis points, \\nwhich also drove a healthy free cash flow of €5 billion for the year. \\nImportantly, the overall shape and quality of the performance was \\nencouraging. We achieved a good balance of price and volume growth. \\nGrowth was broad-based, across each of our three global Divisions – \\nBeauty & Personal Care, Home Care and Foods & Refreshment. Our \\ncontinuing margin progression was underpinned by well-embedded savings and efficiency programmes, and an improving mix from \\nunderlying sales growth in Beauty & Personal Care. \\nInspired by the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, we also saw \\nour brands with the most distinct and well-articulated social and \\nenvironmental purpose grow significantly faster than our other brands. \\nThe performance last year demonstrates I believe that our strategy is \\nworking. By empowering our three global Divisions, we are allowing \\nfor more strategic allocation of resource and for greater differentiation \\nin meeting changing consumer needs. Beauty & Personal Care, for example, made good progress in moving to more premium positions \\nand expanding in the high growth segments. Home Care built on its \\nalready strong emerging market footprint with a strategy of market \\ndevelopment and benefit-led innovation for emerging needs. Whilst \\nFoods & Refreshment was combined into a single division bringing more scale and focus to allow faster transformation of our portfolio. \\nThe results in 2018 re-affirm the enduring strength of Unilever’s \\nbrands and the growing resilience of our organisational model, as well \\nas underlining Unilever’s ability to deliver consistent top and bottom \\nline performance even in very challenging conditions. Nevertheless, we are determined to step up the proportion of our business that is winning market share as part of moving our sales growth more \\nconsistently into the middle of our multi-year 3-5% targeted range. \\nA YEAR OF PROGRESS \\nAs well as delivering a solid set of results, we also made good \\nprogress in 2018 in strengthening the overall business to be ready for future opportunities: \\n• By empowering those closest to the marketplace, and by linking \\nour global brand teams across the world, our Connected for Growth \\n(C4G) organisational model is helping to increase speed and agility, as well as giving rise to a greater entrepreneurial spirit inside the company. As an illustration of this, time to market with new innovations to meet local trends is now 40%-50% faster compared to 2016. We also launched 19 new brands, including Love Home and Planet, a range of plant-based, home-cleaning products and a follow-up to our successful launch of the natural and sustainable hair and skincare product range, Love Beauty and Planet.', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"• In line with our strategy, we continued to move the portfolio in the direction of the faster-growing segments of the market, especially those that speak to consumers’ growing desire for more natural products and purpose-driven brands. The vast majority of businesses we have acquired over recent years are now growing by double digits on a yearly basis and we were delighted at the end of last year to announce the acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline's Health Food Drinks portfolio, including its iconic Horlicks brand in India and the rest of Asia, further increasing our presence in the highly attractive health-food category. We also completed successfully the complex disposal of the spreads business, returning the after-tax proceeds to shareholders. \\n• The way people shop and access brands is changing rapidly and we \\nmade good progress in 2018 in positioning ourselves effectively in new and faster-growing channels. Our e-commerce sales were up by 47%, ahead of global e-commerce market growth and putting us well on the road to building a scale e-commerce business. We also accelerated the growth of our business with Discounters, in the Health and Beauty channel and in the out-of-home eating market. \\n• The digital transformation of the company also continues apace. We \\nare working successfully with leading global technology companies to build world-class technology and data analytics infrastructure. Through the sophisticated and responsible leveraging of our data insights, we are close to reaching our goal of being able to connect directly with a billion of our consumers. In our operations, we have already automated over 700 processes – saving time and reducing cost – and our in-house training programmes are increasingly focussed on the digital up-skilling of our own people. \\n• Our attractiveness as an employer of choice grew still further in \\n2018. Unilever is now the number one FMCG graduate employer of choice in almost 50 countries. That is a remarkable achievement, and testament to Unilever’s values and commitment to be a force for good in the world. \\nStrengthened by these measures, we are good in shape for the future. \\nWe ended 2018 with 58% of our turnover in the emerging markets \\nand enjoying number 1 or 2 positions in 85% of the key markets and \\ncategories in which we compete. Our Beauty & Personal Care business – where some of the biggest growth opportunities exist \\n– now represents 40% of our turnover. All of this makes us well placed \\nto capture the many opportunities that exist across our markets. \\nLOOKING AHEAD \\nBuilding on these strong foundations, I have already made clear that my first priority as CEO will be to accelerate quality growth. For us, that means an investment-led approach based on delivering our 4G growth model – consistent growth, competitive growth, profitable growth and responsible growth, with an equal focus on each. \\nIn particular, I want to leave no doubt that I intend to build further \\non Unilever’s century-old commitment to responsible business. 'Making Sustainable Living Commonplace' will remain our purpose as a company and we will use this to keep Unilever at the forefront of ensuring business is a force for good. More and more of our brands will become explicit about the positive social and environmental impact they have. This is entirely aligned to the instincts of our people and to the expectations of our consumers. It is not about putting purpose ahead of profits, it is purpose that drives profits. \\nDespite the progress we have made in recent years, I am also clear \\nthat – in a world where the speed of change is relentless – we need to \\nquicken the pace of everything we do still further. I want to make speed \\nand skills for a digital age a hallmark of Unilever under my leadership. \\nIf we can do all this then I am confident we can achieve our strategic \\naims and deliver many years of solid cash flow, further underlying operating margin improvement and good quality growth. \\nAND FINALLY…\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='A CHANGING WORLD \\nUNILEVER OPERATES IN THE FAST-MOVING CONSUMER \\nGOODS (FMCG) INDUSTRY, ONE OF THE WORLD’S LARGEST, MOST COMPETITIVE AND DYNAMIC. \\nMARKET OVERVIEW \\nThe top 25 global FMCG players generate sales of over €700 billion \\nin markets characterised by their dynamic nature. A global, digital economy is fuelling rapid change characterised by fragmentation throughout the value chain. This requires fast, innovative, profitable global and local responses in areas such as supply chain, customer development, marketing and brand innovation. \\nIn response, Unilever has reorganised into three Divisions: Beauty \\n& Personal Care, Foods & Refreshment and Home Care. Each has \\nimplemented our C4G change programme which was introduced in 2016 \\nto create a simpler organisation capable of innovating more quickly to \\nevolve our brand portfolios and meet changing trends more effectively \\n– harnessing our global scale and local expertise. Acquisitions of new \\nbrands have further supplemented our core portfolios. \\nThe use and threat of tariffs for political leverage continues to drive \\nuncertainty in our markets. Currency volatility in Argentina, Turkey \\nand Pakistan as well as major political disruption in markets such as Brazil, continues to demand rapid local responses from our brands. \\nOur business is shaped by systemic macro forces. We periodically \\nreview these to ensure our strategy remains relevant. We believe there are four distinct but overlapping macro trends that will shape \\nthe world over the next ten years. \\nDIGITAL AND TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION \\nBusiness is evolving at a faster pace than ever. Traditional understanding \\nand engagement with consumers is being redefined. Digital technology is transforming relationships with consumers – from connectivity and the Internet of Things, to robotics, artificial intelligence and augmented reality. All are linked by more targeted and data-driven marketing. \\nFragmentation remains a principal driver of change, impacting \\nconsumer journeys, route-to-market channels and media, and brand spend. Consumers are taking different paths to purchase, often combining offline and online channels where influencers are a growing force. Younger consumers continue to prioritise meaning over materialism and are demanding more authenticity, transparency and natural ingredients. The talkability of brands is vital in a fragmented digital media landscape, favouring those with a strong point of view, or purpose, relevant to consumers. The growth of the global workforce and middle class consumers, especially in emerging markets, has resulted in long-term shifts favouring greater convenience and time-saving attributes. \\nChannels to reach consumers are equally fragmented. There is \\nless reliance on ‘big box’ retailers with e-commerce growing 13% globally, driven by direct-to-consumer models and platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba. The market is also polarising between specialist channels and discounters and convenience stores, creating both risks and opportunities for FMCG companies. \\nThe proliferation of digital and social media channels has resulted in \\nmedia fragmentation, with digital advertising now about 40% of the market. However, improving standards and tackling fraud to protect the integrity of digital marketing are major challenges. \\nPOLARISED WORLD \\nSlow and uneven economic growth, rising inequality, political \\npolarisation and the rise of nationalism within countries is impacting \\nconsumer confidence. At the same time, consumers continue \\nto have low confidence in government, business, media and NGOs, \\naccording to the Edelman Trust Barometer. However, according to the \\nsame study, three out of four people agree a company can take action \\nto both increase profits while improving economic and social conditions \\nin the community it operates in.

       " Document(page_content='to both increase profits while improving economic and social conditions \\nin the community it operates in. ENVIRONMENT UNDER PRESSURE \\nAccording to a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\nreport, the world is on course for warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius by as early as 2030. Drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions are threatened if no action is taken to curb emissions. The cost of inaction will be profound, estimated to be about $44 trillion in lost GDP. But the rewards for positive action are substantial and thanks to the Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries are pursuing \\ncarbon reforms. This is helping to open about $23 trillion in opportunities \\nfor climate-smart investments in 21 emerging markets alone by 2030. \\nClimate change also threatens our food system which must produce \\n50% more food to feed over 9 billion people by 2050. However, \\nchanging weather patterns and growing seasons threaten suitable \\ncultivation areas around the world. Business can spur positive change \\nand achieving food security could create 80 million jobs and business \\nopportunities worth $2.3 trillion annually by 2030. Linked to climate change is water scarcity, a threat to 3.2 billion people. If current usage \\ncontinues the world will have only 60% of its required water by 2030. \\nSee pages 30 and 33 to 35 for more on climate change risks. \\nOther environmental concerns are growing in significance, such as \\nplastic packaging. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that 95% \\nof the value of plastic packaging is lost to the economy after one short \\nuse, equivalent of $80-120 billion lost to the global economy each year. See pages 14 to 15 and 30 for more on plastic packaging risks and opportunities. \\nPEOPLE LIVING DIFFERENTLY \\nConcerns about the planet and society are matched by concerns about our own health and what we eat. Growing urbanisation is shaping new \\nhealth priorities while the cost of care is also rising, placing health \\nservices under increased pressure. Obesity kills more people than \\nhunger, while many populations struggle to find sufficient nourishment \\nin their diets. Sugar is seen as a major threat which has resulted in a number of countries choosing to implement a tax on it. For food \\ncompanies, this presents a mix of challenges and opportunities. \\nMeanwhile, public awareness around mental health issues continues \\nto grow, particularly with digital connectivity. \\nConsumers are now living in communities that are becoming more \\ndiverse with fragmented identities. Younger generations, especially \\nMillennials and Generation Z, continue to have a powerful influence \\non cultural norms – on issues such as diversity and discrimination. \\nMeanwhile, older generations are exerting a strong economic \\ninfluence. The number of people aged 80 or over is expected to triple by 2050. \\nMigration is having a profound effect on national identity. One in 30 \\npeople are international migrants living abroad, a 40% rise since 2000. People are encouraged to move, in part, by the rise of global \\nmegacities with more than ten million inhabitants. The number of \\nthese will rise from 31 to 41 by 2030. Such urbanisation is expected \\nto create an additional 500 million one-person households between 2016 and 2030. Climate change looks set to increase migration even further as populations are displaced due to rising sea levels and changing climates. \\nThe #MeToo movement has encapsulated a major shift in women’s \\nrights. The global gender gap in primary school completion and \\nenrolment in secondary school has closed, however barriers and opportunities remain, particularly on equal pay. According to the \\nWorld Bank, gender equality would enrich the global economy by \\nan estimated $160 trillion if women were earning as much as men in the workplace.

Innovation is the fuel, creating great products that consumers love, from nutritionally balanced foods and refreshments, to affordable soaps that combat disease, luxurious shampoos and everyday household care products. Whatever the brand, wherever it is bought, we’re working to ensure that it plays a part in helping fulfil our purpose as a business – making sustainable living commonplace. \\nBEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE \\nBEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE (BPC) GENERATED TURNOVER OF €20.6 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 40% OF UNILEVER’S TURNOVER AND 33% OF OPERATING PROFIT IN 2018. \\nThe Division is our largest and includes five global brands with \\nturnover of €1 billion or above, namely Axe, Dove, Lux, Rexona and \\nSunsilk, as well as other household names such as TRESemmé, \\nSignal, Lifebuoy and Vaseline. BPC has leading global positions in \\nhair care, skin cleansing and deodorants, and strong local positions in \\nskin care and oral care. The prestige business leads in premiumising our portfolio with turnover of €490 million from brands including Dermalogica and Hourglass. \\nBPC’s strategic ambition is to become the most valuable and admired \\nBPC company, led by its purpose ‘Beauty that cares for people, society and our planet’. Its priorities are to continue to grow its core brands, build a future-fit portfolio, lead in high-growth spaces and adopt a new model of marketing. The priorities reflect and respond to key trends shaping the Division. 2018 saw increasing fragmentation across route to market, retail channels and media, alongside growing data, analytic and automation capabilities. Together these trends are creating a more dynamic, complex and sophisticated landscape with greater segmentation, differentiation and personalisation. \\nBPC’s core brands are introducing new innovations and formats quickly and \\nat scale, such as the new shower mousses from Axe, Dove and Radox as well as a growing range of products which respond to the trend for natural and wellbeing products. During 2018 we launched Vaseline Clinical Care and Dove Derma Series in the fast-growing therapeutics segment and Dove Facial Cleansing Series infused with 100% plant-derived botanical oils in Japan. Hair care has created and launched multiple naturals products, creating a business with over €300 million in turnover in 2018. \\nSucceeding in the hyper-fragmented world demands greater consumer \\nresponsiveness and we are proud to have launched nine new brands over the past two years: ApotheCARE Essentials, Hijab Fresh, K-Bright, K-JU, Korea Glow, Love Beauty and Planet, Pure Derm, Purifi and Skinsei.

       " Document(page_content=\"Our acquisitions play a key role in building the future-fit portfolio. In the \\nlast four years, BPC has acquired 13 companies including wellbeing focused Equilibra in 2018. AHC (Carver Korea), acquired in 2017, showed strong e-commerce performance and in 2018, we rolled it out to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Russia. Schmidt’s Naturals, also acquired in 2017, has extended beyond deodorants into more categories. The acquisition of Quala S.A completed in February 2018. Within two months of acquisition, its Savile and Ego extensions had brought to market multiple new products in five categories. Strong progress has been made building a highly attractive prestige portfolio which is on track to becoming a €1 billion business. Our most recent acquisition in prestige, Hourglass, is growing fast, expanding into new geographies and with a commitment to become entirely vegan by 2020. \\nFuture growth will depend on accelerating the adoption of a new model \\nof marketing focused on brands with purpose, generating great content, \\ndelivered via digital channels using advanced data and analytics. The \\nmodel is creating many new consumer touchpoints. For instance, Axe \\ncollaborated with DJ Martin Garrix to launch his Burn Out video with over 40 million YouTube views to date, celebrating the brand's message of individuality. In Latin America, Sunsilk partnered with an online \\ninfluencer to co-create products for curly hair. \\nOur purpose-led brands are well positioned to meet growing concerns \\nabout the fragility of the planet and consumer preference for more sustainable products. In October we joined calls from consumers, NGOs \\nand politicians for a worldwide ban on animal testing of cosmetics and Dove, the Division’s biggest brand, achieved PETA accreditation as ‘cruelty free’. The PETA cruelty-free logo will start appearing on many packs \\nin 2019 and more brands are set to follow. We are also developing new \\npackaging solutions with less plastic, better plastic and no plastic. \\nREN launched a sea kelp and magnesium body wash in a bottle made from 100% recycled plastic, with 20% from recovered ocean plastic. Simple launched biodegradable face wipes made from renewable plant \\nfibres and sustainable wood pulp. More packaging innovations will be \\nlaunched in 2019. \\nOverall, underlying sales growth was 3.1%, driven by skin care and \\nskin cleansing, but partly offset by slower growth in deodorants \\nand oral care due to market and competitive pressures. Profitability progressed with underlying operating margin improving 80 basis points to 21.9%. Geographically, a number of countries grew above the market including US, Canada and the UK while emerging markets such as Pakistan and Bangladesh also had high growth. Brazil underperformed as did Japan and parts of Western Europe, where markets were flat to declining. In our channels, e-commerce remains a key driver of growth alongside the Health & Beauty channel where we would like to see faster growth following a slow year, especially in North America. \\nLooking ahead, we will continue to build our future-fit portfolio \\nwhile adopting the new model of marketing, to deliver strong growth, \\nmaking an accretive contribution to Unilever’s top and bottom line. \\nFOODS & REFRESHMENT \\nFOODS & REFRESHMENT (F&R) GENERATED TURNOVER OF €20.2 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 40% OF UNILEVER’S TURNOVER AND 58% OF OPERATING PROFIT IN 2018. \\nThe Division launched in January 2018 after the previous Foods and \\nRefreshment Categories merged.

F&R’s purpose 'Taste good, Feel good, Force for good' \\nunderpins our strategic priorities which are to: transform the portfolio; organise for agility and lower costs; and transform capabilities. \\nOur efforts to transform the F&R portfolio are driven by consumer \\ninsights. For example, we are seeing stronger preference for healthier \\nproducts with more natural and organic ingredients. F&R has launched \\na number of products addressing this trend, including Magnum and Hellmann’s vegan variants in Europe, meat-free Knorr launches in the Nordics and Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy alternatives. Knorr also expanded \\nits organic and 100% natural ranges in Europe. In our beverages \\ncategory, we continue to grow our ‘good for me tea’ ranges. Lipton’s \\nrange, which includes variants such as detox and stress-less, continued \\nits global roll-out with strong performance. Recently acquired brands \\nsuch as Pukka Herbs are being rolled out at pace. However, given \\ncontinuous acceleration of the external landscape, we have to step \\nup portfolio transformation further and increase the speed of our \\nresponse to trends. \\nOur market-focused organisation and agility supports our portfolio \\ntransformation and delivered several new brands in 2018 such as \\nRED RED (UK), Culture Republick (US), and Jawara (Indonesia).

       " Document(page_content='DELIVERING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUED \\nConsumers’ shopping habits continue to change. We launched the \\nIceCreamNow platform in partnership with restaurant delivery services, building a new home-delivery channel. We have also launched a global front-of-house programme to showcase our teas and condiments \\nin restaurants, hotels and bars, and to capitalise on the growth of \\neating out and out-of-home consumption. These represent significant \\nbusiness opportunities. \\nThe second F&R strategic priority is to organise for agility and lower \\ncosts. In 2018, our 5S and ZBB programmes stepped up fuelling our \\ngross margin and marketing support. We will continue our savings programme to reduce structural costs, while providing funding for portfolio transformation and margin expansion. Our speed to market \\nhas improved by almost a third, reflecting how C4G is helping to \\nunlock speed and agility. We are also piloting new ways of working \\nacross our teams. \\nOur final strategic priority is to transform our capabilities with a focus \\non R&D, lean innovation and precision marketing. The creation of our state-of-the art global Foods Innovation Centre in Wageningen \\n(Netherlands) will further strengthen our innovation capability. It is \\nscheduled to open in 2019. We are also enhancing our capabilities in \\ndigital-driven marketing through extra resourcing across key markets, upskilling our current teams and hiring digital savvy marketeers. \\nThese strategic priorities are underpinned by the development of \\nmore purpose-led brands. Knorr, Hellmann’s, Lipton, Brooke Bond and Ben & Jerry’s continued to grow, each fuelled by a unique purpose which is resonating with consumers. Brooke Bond for example continued its work tackling cultural taboos through its campaigns, addressing same-sex relationships in Canada and divorce in the Gulf markets. Meanwhile, Hellmann’s launched a major focus on food waste with an activation in Brazil to inspire people to use Hellmann’s to transform leftovers into tasty meals. Action on plastic packaging is another priority for F&R. We have partnered with Ioniqa and Indorama Ventures to pioneer a technology which converts PET waste into virgin grade material for use in food packaging. In the UK, PG tips started to introduce 100% biodegradable plant-based pyramid bags. More innovations and new technologies are in the pipeline. \\nDuring 2018 F&R turnover declined 9.9% to €20.2 billion, due to the \\nsale of spreads and currency devaluation. Underlying sales growth was 2.0% while our underlying operating margin improved by 80 basis points to reach 17.5%. Europe returned good results in ice cream, underpinned by good weather and innovations such as Magnum pints and Kinder ice cream. However, developed markets overall remain difficult and are seeing slower volume growth due to increasing segmentation of consumer preferences, especially in foods, where our efforts on portfolio transformation were not enough to offset the headwinds. Traditional channels in Europe such as supermarkets and hypermarkets continue to discount, creating deflationary pressure. Latin America had a challenging year due to tough economic conditions, a truckers’ strike in Brazil and currency headwinds in Argentina which affected growth in these two markets. Excluding Latin America, emerging markets generally delivered a strong performance. Several key markets including India, China and Turkey saw double-\\ndigit growth reflecting the strong potential in emerging markets. \\nF&R will continue to drive growth and margin by focusing on its strategic \\npriorities.

Other leading \\nbrands include Comfort, Domestos, Sunlight, Cif, Seventh Generation as \\nwell as our air and water purification brands Blueair, Pureit and Truliva/ \\nQinyuan. 79.5% of our turnover is in developing and emerging countries. Home Care’s ambition is to deliver sustained underlying sales growth and step up underlying operating margin. \\nThe rapid change of consumer habits, media, competitors and channels, \\nas well as heightened environmental stress, has redefined Home Care’s growth opportunities. The Division responded to these changes by creating four consumer-centric categories: Fabric solutions which focuses on ready to wear clothes (eg Omo, Surf, Radiant); Fabric sensations which focuses on fabrics, fashion and lifestyle (eg Comfort, Snuggle); Home & hygiene \\n(eg Sunlight, Sun) which focuses on delivering care for a cleaner world; \\nand life essentials which unites our air and water purification brands (eg \\nPureit, Truliva, Blueair). Home Care’s purpose 'Making your home a better world. Making our world a better home' underpins the Division’s strategic priorities: strengthening further the foundation of the business; making \\nHome Care fit for the future; and investing in capabilities. \\nHome Care strengthened the foundations of the business by delivering \\nsuperior products and benefits. We launched Cif Specialist sprays \\nacross 15 countries in Europe whilst continuing to roll-out our toilet \\nblocks to 11 more markets. We expanded our product portfolio into \\nhigh potential geographies, building on our most established brands \\nsuch as Omo-branded floor cleaners in Brazil. Our Comfort Intense \\nultra-concentrated fabric conditioners are now in 20 markets and \\ncontinue to enjoy strong growth. \\nOur brands made progress in embracing purpose to connect more \\nmeaningfully with consumers – in particular millennials. In India, \\nDomex enrolled renowned movie stars in its 'Pick up the brush' campaign to help overcome the social stigma associated with cleaning toilets, a key barrier to improve sanitation. Seventh Generation, \\nacquired in 2016, stepped up its advocacy for Climate Justice together \\nwith the Sierra Club to move cities to commit to 100% renewable \\nenergy. Home Care’s biggest brand, Omo/Persil, joined forces with National Geographic, IKEA and Lego to promote the developmental benefits of play in children. \\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to future-proof our business to lead \\nnew trends. We intensified our efforts and increased our footprint in the fast-growing natural segment through the launch of Omo naturals in New Zealand, France and Brazil among others, the roll-out of Seventh Generation in more markets and the launch of Sunlight Naturals across South-East Asia and South Africa. Our brands such as Cif, Omo/Persil and Seventh Generation responded to growing concerns about plastic by including recycled plastic in their packaging. Home Care launched Day2, a dry wash spray that revives clothes between washes – saving time and water. Our ultra-concentrated laundry gems, a new format launched in the UK in 2017, performed below expectations. In South Africa we reacted quickly to the drought in Cape Town with Domestos Flush Less, a toilet spray that disinfects and eliminates odours without the need to flush. We increased our presence in e-commerce, crossing €500 million of sales and continued to experiment with new business models such as peer-to-peer laundry services. \\nThe third strategic pillar is investing in our capabilities.

This includes \\npartnering to tap into the opportunities that data brings to make Home Care more efficient and better able to seize growth opportunities. In China, our water purification brand, Truliva, partnered with Alibaba to develop an online leasing market for water purifiers. We also joined forces with Ms Paris, the Chinese dress rental platform, that allows consumers to hire designer dresses and return without laundering. To support our R&D efforts, we have inaugurated the Materials \\nInnovation Factory at the University of Liverpool, a world-class centre \\nof excellence in advanced material chemistry and an ecosystem that \\nbrings together innovation partners and leading academics to develop \\nmore sustainable and superior formula and packaging for our brands. \\nHome Care delivered underlying sales growth of 4.2% while our \\nunderlying operating margin improved by 80 basis points to reach 13.0%. \\nKey drivers of growth were North and South Asia with South East Asia, Middle-East, Turkey and the US also performing strongly. By contrast, \\nour performance in Latin America was challenged by a trucker’s strike \\nand extreme inflationary pressures. Our home & hygiene and fabric \\nsensations categories delivered strong, broad-based profitable growth \\nwhereas life essentials performed below expectations largely driven by a significant decline in category growth in air purification in China and \\nintense competitive pressures. Margin expansion in fabric solutions was \\nhampered by inflationary headwinds and competitive pressures on pricing. \\nHome Care will continue to drive growth and margin by shifting our \\nportfolio and footprint towards the higher growth, more profitable \\nmarket segments, formats, channels and geographies while \\ncontinuing to address with agility changing consumer preferences. \\n12 \\nStrategic Report Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\nOUR MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MODEL AIMS TO REWARD OUR \\nSHAREHOLDERS WHILE POSITIVELY IMPACTING SOCIETY. \\nOur impact on society starts with our 155,000 employees who received \\n€5.3 billion in pay in 2018, and extends across our value chain including \\nthe millions of retailers and distributors who sell our products in more \\nthan 190 countries, generating income and employment for many more. Our suppliers also benefit from the €34 billion we spent on goods and services in 2018. The taxes we pay are another important contribution to society. Total tax borne by Unilever in 2018 was €3.7 billion, of which €2.3 billion was corporation tax. Unilever fully complies with the tax laws in the countries where we operate. Where tax law is unclear, or has not kept pace with modern business practice, we interpret our obligations in a responsible way, guided by our Tax Principles. \\nUNILEVER SUSTAINABLE LIVING PLAN \\nOur impact on society is significant but we want our impact to go beyond business as usual, delivering value for multiple stakeholders at the same time as growing our business. This idea is encapsulated in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) which represents a simple idea – that business growth and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. By focusing on sustainable growth, we believe we will generate consistent and profitable long-term shareholder returns. The USLP has three big goals: improving the health and well-being of more than one billion people by 2020; halving our environmental footprint by 2030; and enhancing livelihoods for millions by 2020. These goals are supported by over 50 time-bound stretching targets and a transformational change agenda which aims to create change on a systemic scale. We are making good progress overall against our targets although some remain a challenge to achieve by the end of 2020. Our Sustainable Living Report includes extensive disclosure on progress against our USLP targets including challenges we have faced, some of which are summarised in this section of the Annual Report & Accounts. \\nOur actions on sustainability are creating value in numerous ways, \\ngenerating more growth, lower costs, less risk and more trust in the business. Our Sustainable Living brands, which combine a powerful purpose with products contributing to the USLP, are a key driver of growth. In 2017, 26 of our top 40 brands were Sustainable Living brands including Ben & Jerry’s, Dove and Lifebuoy. Our Sustainable Living brands grew 46% faster than our other brands and accounted for 70% of total growth. Product innovations which respond to water scarcity and climate change at the same time as helping consumers, continue to create growth opportunities for us. Recent sustainability innovations which deliver consumer benefits include our new Love Beauty and Planet range in the US which uses fast-rinse technology in its conditioners thereby requiring less water. Domestos Flush Less, available in water-scarce South Africa, keeps toilets clean while saving nine litres of water per flush. \\nThe USLP strengthens our business by helping us to save costs. Since \\nour baseline year of 2008 we have saved over €600 million on energy costs in our factories; and by using fewer materials and producing less waste we have avoided costs of approximately €234 million. \\nThrough the USLP, we are also responding directly to a number of \\nmacro forces (see page 8) that are both risks and opportunities in our \\nmarkets – such as a lack of access to water and sanitation, strains \\non the food system, climate, the environment, and rising inequality. \\nWe have identified the broad issue of sustainability, related to the \\nachievement of our goals in the USLP, as a principal risk (page 29)', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"We have identified the broad issue of sustainability, related to the \\nachievement of our goals in the USLP, as a principal risk (page 29) \\nas well as a number of specific risks including climate change (page \\n30) and plastic packaging (page 30). Mitigating the physical impacts \\nof climate change is critical because we depend on raw materials \\nsourced from countries that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea \\ntemperatures and changing weather patterns. See pages 33 to 35 for \\nour response to the risks and opportunities from a low-carbon economy. \\nTrust is essential for any business, but it must be earned. The USLP is a \\nkey driver of trust among our employees and potential recruits. We are the \\nnumber one FMCG graduate employer of choice in around\\xa050 countries \\nwhere we recruit. We have been ranked first in the annual GlobeScan \\nsurvey of sustainability leaders for eight years and also came top of the \\nDow Jones Sustainability Index Personal Products sector in 2018. IMPROVING HEALTH & WELL-BEING \\nOur activities impact the health and well-being of millions of people \\n– through brand-led health and hygiene, and nutrition interventions. Significant progress has been made against our first USLP goal of helping more than one billion people improve their health and well\\xadbeing by 2020. By the end of 2018, we had reached 653 million people, making a significant contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal on Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6). \\nIn order to increase the reach and social impact of some of our biggest \\nhealth & hygiene programmes we continue to explore the potential of using \\nmass media and digital to drive behaviour change at greater scale, as well as scaling up partnerships to increase the reach of more conventional \\non-ground programmes. Dove, one of Unilever’s biggest brands which grew \\nat 7.8% in 2018, has reached around 35 million young people since 2004 \\nthrough its Self-Esteem Project. To expand its reach, Dove has partnered \\nwith the Cartoon Network to create Steven Universe mini episodes which bring to life the proven themes from our on-ground programmes to boost \\nself-esteem for young people. Our aim is that this will reach 20 million \\nyoung people over the next two years. This series is supported by a music \\nvideo which has so far received over 1.8 million views on YouTube. As well as \\nreaching more young people with body confidence messaging, this activity is helping to raise overall awareness of Dove’s work to improve self-esteem \\nwhich correlates with higher purchase intent. \\nSince 2010, Lifebuoy's programmes have reached 458 million people \\nthrough schools, health clinics and community outreach. Lifebuoy has recently expanded its behaviour change programme on the importance of handwashing with soap using mobile technology. The new service aims to reach out to women in media dark areas, providing free advice to mothers on their child’s health. Another recent Lifebuoy partnership with Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) ties together the importance of handwashing with soap and immunisation, using a variety of channels including home visits and mobile communications. While our programmes have focused on reaching children and mothers on-ground, we have long believed that TV advertising can drive behaviour change. To test this, we ran a study in India to assess the effectiveness of specific Lifebuoy TV adverts. The study showed a significant increase in the frequency of handwashing with soap after people watched the adverts. We are progressing with peer review publication of our study. \\nFor more than a decade, we have been working to make our products\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"For more than a decade, we have been working to make our products \\neven healthier by increasing goodness and reducing nutrients of concern like sugar, salt and saturated fat. We aim to double the proportion of our portfolio that meets the highest nutritional standards, based on globally recognised dietary guidelines. So far 48% of our products have reached this standard and we are on track to meet our 2020 commitment. We are also using the power of our brands to empower people to make responsible choices. In support of our Code Policy on Responsible Marketing, in 2018 95% of our Foods and Refreshment portfolio had full nutrition labelling on pack that aligned with Unilever’s product labelling criteria (based on 96% of global sales from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018). We continued our efforts to improve the goodness in our products and set out the ambition to provide 200 billion servings by 2022 containing at least one of the 5 key micronutrients: iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin A or D. We are \\ndeveloping plans to deliver against the ambition. \\nREDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \\nOur activities impact the environment, principally through the use of water, \\nenergy and land as well as the production of waste and greenhouse gas \\nemissions, largely as a result of consumer use. These impacts are reflected \\nin the USLP environmental pillar and are supported by our Environmental \\nPolicy which is available on our website. Our environmental big goal is by \\n2030 to halve the environmental footprint of the making and use of our \\nproducts as we grow our business. This is a challenging target requiring \\naction across our value chain on waste, water and greenhouse gas \\nemissions – in turn contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. \\nAs a consumer goods company, we are acutely aware of the causes \\nand consequences of the linear 'take-make-dispose' model of consumption. We are taking action across our value chain to reduce, \\nreuse, recycle and recover post-consumer waste and move towards \\na more circular model. Our manufacturing operations have seen a \\nreduction in total waste disposed to landfill, or incineration without energy recovery, of around 97% per tonne of production since 2008. \\n13 \\nStrategic Report Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

We are more than half way towards meeting our 2020 commitment to reduce waste associated with the disposal of \\nour products. This has reduced by about 31% since 2010 due to \\nincreases in consumer recycling and changes in our portfolio. \\nIn 2017, we made a further commitment on waste, ensuring that all our \\nplastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by \\n2025. We are moving in the right direction to make all of our packaging \\nrecyclable but there is more work to do. Find out more on page 15. Seventh Generation is eliminating virgin petroleum plastic (new plastic made from oil) and virgin fibre (virgin wood pulp) from its packs and has \\ncommitted that all its packaging will be fully recyclable or compostable \\nby 2020. In Brazil, Omo is launching its first plant-based detergent in a \\n100% recyclable pack containing recycled plastic. \\nWe have reduced the water used in manufacturing by 44% per tonne \\nof production since 2008. Our biggest water impact occurs when consumers shower, bathe and clean clothes with our products. In \\n2018, our water impact per consumer use reduced by around 2% \\ncompared to 2010. We recognise that we are a long way short of \\nhalving our water impact and we will not achieve this very challenging target by the end of 2020. This is due in part to our portfolio being made up of more products that have a higher than average water \\nfootprint than in 2010 and the significant consumer behaviour change \\nneeded to reduce water consumption when our products are used, \\nwhere the vast majority of our water footprint resides. Going forward we want to broaden our water strategy by recognising the role of water in our consumers’ lives and its importance as a growth driver for our business. We are developing and launching innovative products which deliver the benefits people need with less water, or even no water at all, as well as products that improve the quality of water. \\nAs with water, our biggest greenhouse gas impact comes through \\nconsumer use. The greenhouse gas impact of our products across their lifecycle has increased by about 6% since 2010. We are having more success in areas that are within our direct control such as manufacturing where we have cut CO\\n2 from energy by 52% per tonne \\nof production compared to 2008. Similarly, we continue to make savings through the ongoing roll-out of freezer cabinets that use more climate-friendly natural (hydrocarbon) refrigerants. Our ability to meet our target partly depends on changes in the energy markets worldwide, such as the rate of installation of renewable electricity in many countries. We have a role to play as an industry leader to help shape those markets. We are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (see pages 33 to 35). Two of our carbon reduction targets have been officially approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. \\nOur sustainable sourcing strategy focuses on a set of key agricultural \\ncrops, which are not only crucial to our brands, but also where we can drive measurable impact for sustainable transformation of the industry. By the end of 2018, the total volume of our agricultural raw materials that were sustainably sourced was 56%. In line with our strategy, sustainably sourced volumes for our 12 key crops increased \\nby over 4% including significant increases for palm oil and tea, whilst \\nour sustainably sourced volumes for non-key crops reduced.

We deepened our commitment to transparency with \\nthe publication of our palm oil mill list and the creation of a grievance \\ntracker for our palm oil supply; and we, along with key NGOs including \\nWWF, initiated a new jurisdictional approach to palm oil in Malaysia. \\nThe additional programmes were also supported by digital solutions like leveraging satellite data for deforestation detection and risk \\nassessments, mapping of smallholder parcels in Indonesia, sending \\ncritical weather alerts to farmers' mobiles in India, and using the \\nInternet of Things to optimise tea production in Kenya. We are also \\npiloting innovative approaches to achieving upstream traceability in several supply chains. ENHANCING LIVELIHOODS \\nOur activities have the potential to positively impact the livelihoods of \\nnot only our employees, but the millions of people who are involved in our value chain – notably smallholder farmers and small-scale retailers. By 2020, we aim to enhance the livelihoods of millions of people as we grow our business. In 2018, we made steady progress across the three pillars of our Enhancing Livelihoods goal. \\nWe believe that women's empowerment is the single greatest enabler \\nof development and economic growth. We are building a gender-balanced organisation (page 16) while improving women’s safety in \\nthe communities in which we operate, and developing employment opportunities through the Shakti programme which has provided work \\nfor around 113,000 women, equipping them to sell Unilever products \\nin low income rural communities. Shakti continues to scale up in India, \\nSri Lanka, Pakistan and Nigeria and is now being rolled out to new \\ncountries, including Colombia. By 2018, we had also enabled about 1,724,000 women to access initiatives aiming to develop their skills. \\nAs well as directly creating wealth and jobs, our business supports \\nmillions of people who source, make and sell our products – we call this inclusive business. By 2018, we had enabled 746,000 smallholder \\nfarmers and over 1.7 million small-scale retailers to access initiatives \\nto improve agricultural practices or increase incomes. The Philippines \\nKabisig programme, for example, has reached over 165,000 small retailers, training them in stock control, financial management, sales and customer service – increasing the earning potential of small-scale retailers at the same time as growing turnover for Unilever. \\nOur Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) is at the heart of our ambition \\nto source 100% of procurement spend responsibly and through suppliers that meet our RSP requirements. In 2018, we focused on completing the onboarding of high risk suppliers into our compliance database and programme. Over 20,000 suppliers have now completed their registration and are undergoing review processes allowing us to verify their compliance to the RSP and identify areas for remediation. In 2018, 61% of procurement spend was through suppliers who were assessed as meeting the mandatory requirements of the RSP. \\nWe continued to embed human rights with a focus on our eight \\nsalient issues (ie those at risk of the most severe negative impact \\nthrough Unilever’s activities or business relationships). We also began \\na process to review these through a series of global and regional \\nconsultations. This year, one of our primary areas of focus has been \\non the eradication of forced labour in our supply chain through training, capacity building and driving a robust vetting process for \\ntemporary labour agencies.

Automation, flexible resourcing \\nand new business models continue to impact our business and workforce. The workforce expects more flexibility and is increasingly freelance. A job for life is no longer the norm. Once employed, people must regularly reinvent themselves with new skills. The digital transformation of work and growth of automation is bringing both great benefits, but also great disruption. The composition of the workforce is changing too. By 2020, Millennials will make up around 35% of the global workforce. Just over half of Unilever's own workforce in 2018 were Millennials. \\nCREATING A FUTURE-FIT WORKFORCE \\nIn response to the trends outlined above, we are taking action across \\nour business, including simplifying processes and ways of working \\nto free people from non-value adding tasks so they can focus on key \\npriorities. 2018 saw the continued implementation of Connected 4 Growth (C4G), our organisational change programme, and the creation of three new Divisions to bring further focus and simplicity. Our regular surveys show that 74% of our people now feel more empowered to make decisions. Our time to bring innovations to market\\n is now 40-50% faster than in 2016. \\nWith the advance of AI and robotics, it is more important than ever that we strike the right balance between the use of technology and more human-centred approaches. We have invested in Una Hub, an AI-based platform, which automates responses to all general employee enquiries so People Experience Leads and HR Business Partners can focus on more complex queries, and provide face-to-face support where relevant. \\nOur research shows that a focus on purpose helps attract talent \\nand binds us together for growth. Through our People with Purpose programme, more than 30,000 employees have joined workshops to help them define their purpose, with 50,000 targeted by 2019. Our global Univoice survey results reinforce the importance of these workshops – 92% of employees who believe they can live their purpose at Unilever, also say that their job inspires them to go the extra mile. \\nAs the workplace changes it is important that we continue to prioritise \\nmental wellbeing. In 2018, we officially recognised World Mental \\nHealth Day in October and continue to invest in the mental wellbeing \\nof our people, alongside their physical wellbeing. This builds on the \\nroll-out of a mental wellbeing framework globally several years ago \\nwhich guides us in tackling the health risks across our business. \\nAnother area of focus is on personalising training and capability \\nbuilding to develop the right leaders and teams who are fit for the future. We are responding to demands for new skills through continuous learning. Since the launch of Degreed, our online learning \\nplatform in 2017, 76,000 people have access to 2.3 million pieces of \\nlearning content, with 55,000 pieces being consumed on a monthly \\nbasis, including PowerUp, our digital upskilling programme.

Of our total workforce of 154,848, 101,383 (65%) were male and 53,465 (35%) were female at the end of 2018. \\nWe run programmes across Unilever aimed at attracting, retaining \\nand developing female talent. This includes developing candidates for potential future roles, aiming for 'balanced slates' so that we interview equal numbers of men and women for roles, and practical help such as a minimum 16 weeks paid maternity leave as a global standard – more than the regulatory requirement in over 50% of countries where we operate. In 2018, we also committed to introduce by the end of 2019, three weeks of fully paid paternity leave as a benefit to all new fathers, adopting partners and parents in same-sex couples. \\nUnilever has a commitment to gender equality and fairness in the \\nworkplace based on equal pay for equal work and achieving greater gender balance. Pay and overall reward is intended to be gender \\nneutral, with any differences between employees in similar jobs \\nreflecting performance and skill. Gender pay gaps develop where \\nthere is a representational imbalance between genders. When we look \\nat our worldwide business as a whole, in countries with more than 250 employees, the average female pay was 26% higher than male \\npay in 2018 (2017: 25%). This is largely due to the fact that 80% of our \\nlower paying blue-collar roles are held by male employees. ‘Equal pay \\nfor equal work’ is our primary ambition and is a crucial part of fair \\ncompensation. Our Framework for Fair Compensation reviews the average pay differences between genders at each work level and in \\neach country. The most recent analysis highlights that there is more \\nwork to do to continue improving our gender balance, and related \\ngender pay gaps, at various levels and in various countries throughout \\nthe business. \\nBUSINESS INTEGRITY \\nOur principles and values apply to all our employees through our \\nCode and Code Policies. Our employees undertake mandatory annual \\ntraining on these Policies via online training modules and an annual business integrity pledge. Our Business Integrity guidelines include clear processes for managing Code breaches.

Only authorised and appropriately trained employees or representatives can engage with these groups and we require that a record should be kept of all interactions and that all engagement must be conducted: in a transparent manner with honesty, integrity and openness; in compliance with laws and in accordance with Unilever’s values. Our website contains further disclosure on how we engage with our stakeholders. \\nSUPPLIERS \\nOur supply chain is very diverse and highly dynamic as we respond to changing consumer preferences, in line with our C4G programme. Our suppliers help us meet consumer needs by innovating, creating capacity and delivering quality materials and services for our products. We work with a large range of suppliers in over 160 countries – from multinational companies through to SMEs and smallholder farmers. \\nWe screen suppliers in relation to their supply chain capabilities \\nand the level of associated environmental and social risk. Managing supplier risk is a key role of our Supply Chain function. All suppliers must complete our registration process to assess compliance with the mandatory requirements of our Responsible Sourcing Policy which includes anti-bribery and corruption. We conduct audits and follow up issues identified where necessary. \\nPartner to Win is our approach to building long-term relationships \\nwith selected key strategic supplier partners in order to achieve \\nmutual growth. It focuses on five key areas: quality and service, \\ninnovation, value, sustainability and capacity and capability. Partner to Win helps us strengthen supplier and customer collaboration and improves operational efficiency. In 2018, we had 175 Partner \\nto Win suppliers, representing 35% of total procurement spend. \\nWe came first in the annual Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for the third \\nyear running, emphasising our leading practices in the area of supply chain management, in particular on sustainability and digitalisation. \\nCUSTOMERS \\nIn a fragmented channel landscape, those companies that best serve their shoppers and customers with bespoke solutions will benefit \\nmost. Unilever serves consumers through ten different channels: \\nhyper and supermarkets, e-commerce, out of home, drug stores, \\nsmall stores, discounters, Food Solutions, Unilever International, \\nprestige channel and global retail. \\nWe serve around 26 million retail stores globally of which we cover \\neight million directly and another 18 million indirectly through wholesale and cash & carry. \\nIn 2018 we focused on developing our e-commerce channels, digitising \\nour value chain to respond to the rapid fragmentation of traditional routes to market. We are actively driving B2C and B2B e-commerce \\nin our top 30 markets. Our focus is to build a balanced e-commerce \\nbusiness model, growing across e-retailers, bricks and mortar \\nonline sales and direct-to-consumer businesses. In 2018 we signed \\na logistics partnership with JD.com, China's largest retailer.

During 2018 we engaged with shareholders on a number of topics including our Remuneration Policy and on the simplification of Unilever. See page 39 and our website for more details. In addition to direct engagement we regularly engage indirectly via ESG ratings organisations such as MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS, as well as investor-focused sustainability rankings such CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. \\nPERFORMANCE IN 2018 \\nUnderlying sales growth for 2018 was 2.9% and underlying operating \\nmargin was 18.4%, a rise of 90 basis points.

Notable improvements were in India, which was strong across all categories, and China where strong volume growth was seen particularly in e-commerce. Argentina was classified as hyper-inflationary and price growth was excluded from underlying figures from July; any volume growth or decline is included within underlying figures. North America saw an improvement in underlying sales growth and there was acceleration in the US, helped by our acquisition programme in recent years, particularly in BPC. Europe remains challenged by a deflationary environment generally. We delivered solid volume-driven growth across our business with good margin progression. \\nWe generated €5.0 billion of free cash flow and 18.8% return on capital. \\nUnderlying earnings per share was €2.36, a rise of 5.2%, and dividends were increased 8%, reflecting Unilever’s confidence in future profit growth and cash generation. Diluted earnings per share was €3.48. Our share price has fallen 0.42% for PLC shareholders and risen 0.98% for NV shareholders. For information on our non-GAAP measure, see pages 23 to 26. \\nPROGRESS AGAINST OUR 2020 FINANCIAL TARGETS \\nIn April 2017, we set out financial targets for 2020 to further accelerate shareholder value. In 2018 we maintained a strong delivery of savings with over €2 billion of savings from the supply chain, ZBB and change programmes. As a result, we are on track to meet our cumulative \\nsavings target of €6 billion by 2019 and a 2020 underlying operating \\nmargin target of 20%, compared to 16.4% in 2016. \\nWe continue to maintain our leverage by targeting a Net Debt to \\nunderlying EBITDA ratio of 2x, consistent with a credit rating of at least \\nA/A2. During 2018, we returned €6 billion to shareholders through our \\nshare buyback programme following the sale of spreads. \\nDuring the year the Boards decided to withdraw proposals to revise \\nUnilever’s dual-headed legal structure after extensive engagement \\nwith shareholders.

       " Document(page_content=\"preference shares in February 2019 (see page 38). BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION \\nOur brand portfolio continues to evolve to match our Divisions' strategic \\npriorities, resulting in the sale of assets that no longer fit our growth model or the acquisition of assets that take us into new market segments and build new market positions. This active portfolio management means that in the past nine years we have sold €6.8 billion of turnover, mainly in the lower growth foods businesses. During that same period, we have acquired approximately €5.3 billion of turnover. The spreads disposals \\nin July allow Foods & Refreshment to focus on growth. \\nActively managing our brand portfolio through acquisitions and \\ndisposals remains an important strategic growth driver. In December we announced an agreement to acquire the Health Food Drinks \\nportfolio of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in India, Bangladesh and 20 other \\npredominantly Asian markets. Further details of the transaction can \\nbe found on our website. The acquisition includes iconic brands such \\nas Horlicks and Boost, and a product portfolio supported by strong nutritional claims. The transaction is aligned with our strategy to \\nincrease our presence in health-food categories and in high-growth \\nemerging markets. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory \\nand shareholder approvals, with expected completion around \\n12 months from the announcement. \\nIn October we completed the acquisition of a 75% stake in the Italian \\npersonal care business Equilibra which has a growing presence in the natural skin and hair care segments. We also completed the acquisition of Quala’s Beauty & Personal Care and Home Care brands. We acquired a number of exciting new businesses including the Vegetarian Butcher (Netherlands) which expands our portfolio into plant-based foods, and three ice cream brands – Adityaa (India), Betty (Romania) and Denny (Bulgaria). With the exception of brands launched in countries where they were not previously sold, acquisitions and disposals only contribute to underlying sales growth from 12 months after completion. \\nA key part of our 2020 programme is faster portfolio evolution in order \\nto focus Unilever on more rapidly growing segments. This process continued at pace during 2018 with the focus on new brand launches and evolving our core brands. Our C4G organisation means we can respond to consumer trends more quickly. We have launched nearly 30 brands in the last two years. Local brands are also being launched more quickly followed by rapid global roll-out, for instance Breyers Delights, Love Beauty and Planet and Lakme all responding to the trend for more natural and healthy products. \\nEvolving our core brands has also accelerated. Brands such as Dove, \\nLifebuoy and Sunsilk in Beauty & Personal Care all launched new \\nvariants responding to consumer trends. In Home Care there were new \\nlaunches of Domestos, Cif and Comfort while Foods & Refreshment \\nextended the Knorr, Hellmann’s and Lipton brands with new on-trend variants (for more information on brand launches see pages 11 to 12). \\nRealising the opportunities from digital technology to help deliver \\nfurther growth and margin improvement is another key part of our \\nbusiness transformation. We have launched a digital transformation \\nprogramme across all aspects of our value chain. We have 30 \\nplatforms across Unilever which power our business using digital \\ntechnologies. Our Enterprise & Technology Solutions team is set \\nup to deliver a technologically enabled Unilever for the future while \\nensuring that processes and activities are shared and scaled across \\nthe business.

The net impact of acquisitions and disposals was a reduction in turnover of 1.0% (2017: 0.9% increase) with the impact of recent acquisitions such as Carver Korea and Quala outweighed by the disposal of the spreads businesses. Emerging markets contributed 58% of total turnover (2017: 58%) with underlying sales growth of 4.6% (2017: 5.9%) coming from price growth of 1.7% and volume growth of 2.8%.

We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior period average exchange rates into euro, except for countries where the impact of consumer price inflation rates has escalated to extreme levels. In these countries, the local currency amounts before the application of IAS 29 are translated into euros using the period closing exchange rate. The table below shows exchange rate movements in our key markets. \\nAnnual \\naverage \\nrate in \\n2018 Annual \\naverage \\nrate in \\n2017 \\nBrazilian real (€1 = BRL) 4.282 3.573 \\nChinese yuan (€1 = CNY) 7.807 7.608 \\nIndian rupee (€1 = INR) 80.730 73.258 \\nIndonesia rupiah (€1 = IDR) 16831 15011 \\nPhilippine peso (€ 1 = PHP) 62.379 56.596 \\nUK pound sterling (€1 = GBP) 0.884 0.876 \\nUS dollar (€1 = US$) 1.185 1.123 \\nIn the following sections we set out our definitions of the following \\nnon-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures: • underlying sales growth; • underlying volume growth; • underlying price growth; • non-underlying items; • underlying earnings per share; • underlying operating profit and underlying operating margin; • underlying effective tax rate; • constant underlying earnings per share; • free cash flow; • return on assets; • net debt; and • return on invested capital. \\nUNDERLYING SALES GROWTH \\nUnderlying Sales Growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='UNDERLYING SALES GROWTH \\nUnderlying Sales Growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover \\nfor the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from \\nacquisitions, disposals and changes in currency. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used \\ninternally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from \\nUSG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing \\ndate. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution \\nnetwork than the acquisition itself. Also excluded is the impact of price \\ngrowth from countries where the impact of consumer price inflation \\n(CPI) rates has escalated to extreme levels. \\nThere are two countries where we have determined extreme levels \\nof CPI exist. The first is Venezuela where in Q4 2017 inflation rates exceeded 1,000% and management considered that the situation would persist for some time. Consequently, price growth in Venezuela has been excluded from USG since Q4 2017. The second is Argentina, which from Q3 2018 has been accounted for in accordance with IAS 29, and thus from Q3 2018 Argentina price growth is excluded from USG. The adjustment made at Group level as a result of these two exclusions was a reduction in price growth of 32.4% for the year. This treatment for both countries will be kept under regular review. \\nPrior to Q3 2018 USG only excluded the impact of price changes in \\ncountries where consumer price inflation has escalated to extreme levels of 1,000% or more. However, given the need to account for our Argentinian business in accordance with IAS 29, we have now also excluded price changes in countries that need to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 29. Prior to Q3 2018 there were no countries that were accounted for under IAS 29, so no restatements are necessary. \\n23 \\nStrategic Report Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",

Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and exploit the opportunities generated by our business and the markets we are in. In doing this we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment at the core of the Board agenda, which is where we believe it should be. \\nUnilever adopts a risk profile that is aligned to our vision to grow \\nour business, while decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact. Our appetite for risk is driven by the following: • Our growth should be consistent, competitive, profitable \\nand responsible. \\n• Our behaviours must be in line with our Code of Business \\nPrinciples and Code Policies. \\n• We strive to continuously improve our operational efficiency \\nand effectiveness. \\n• We aim to maintain a single A credit rating on a long-term basis. \\nOur approach to risk management is designed to provide reasonable, \\nbut not absolute, assurance that our assets are safeguarded, the risks facing the business are being assessed and mitigated and all information that may be required to be disclosed is reported to Unilever’s senior management including, where appropriate, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. \\nORGANISATION \\nThe Boards assume overall accountability for the management of risk and for reviewing the effectiveness of Unilever’s risk management and internal control systems. \\nThe Boards have established a clear organisational structure with well \\ndefined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. This organisational structure and distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensure that every country in which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the Unilever Leadership Executive, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever. The Boards regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives. \\nFOUNDATION AND PRINCIPLES \\nUnilever’s approach to doing business is framed by our Purpose and values (see page 1). Our Code of Business Principles sets out \\nthe standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere \\nto. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied \\nthroughout Unilever rests with senior management across categories, \\ngeographies and functions. A network of Business Integrity Officers \\nand Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the \\nCode, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including \\nsupport lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to \\ncapture and communicate learnings. We have a framework of Code Policies that underpins the Code \\nof Business Principles and set out the non-negotiable standards of behaviour expected from all our employees. \\nFor each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework \\ndetailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating that risk. \\nUnilever’s functional standards define mandatory requirements across \\na range of specialist areas such as health and safety, accounting and \\nreporting and financial risk management. \\nPROCESSES \\nUnilever operates a wide range of processes and activities across all', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='We identified the material impacts on Unilever’s business arising \\nfrom each of these scenarios based on existing internal and external data. The impacts were assessed without considering any actions that Unilever might take to mitigate or adapt to the adverse impacts or to introduce new products which might offer new sources of revenue as consumers adjust to the new circumstances. \\nThe main impacts of the 2°C scenario were as follows: \\n• Carbon pricing is introduced in key countries and hence there are increases in both manufacturing costs and the costs of raw materials such as dairy ingredients and the metals used in packaging. \\n• Zero net deforestation requirements are introduced and a shift to \\nsustainable agriculture puts pressure on agricultural production, raising the price of certain raw materials. \\nThe main impacts of the 4°C scenario were as follows: • Chronic and acute water stress reduces agricultural productivity \\nin some regions, raising prices of raw materials. \\n• Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) \\ncauses increased incidence of disruption to our manufacturing and distribution networks. \\n• Temperature increase and extreme weather events reduce \\neconomic activity, GDP growth and hence sales levels fall. \\nOur analysis shows that, without action, both scenarios present \\nfinancial risks to Unilever by 2030, predominantly due to increased \\ncosts. However, while there are financial risks which would need to be managed, we would not have to materially change our business \\nmodel. The most significant impacts of both scenarios are on our \\nsupply chain where costs of raw materials and packaging rise, due \\nto carbon pricing and rapid shift to sustainable agriculture in a 2°C \\nscenario and due to chronic water stress and extreme weather in a 4°C scenario. The impacts on sales and our own manufacturing \\noperations are relatively small. \\nThe results of this analysis confirm the importance of doing further \\nwork to ensure that we understand the critical dependencies of climate change on our business and to ensure we have action plans \\nin place to help mitigate these risks and thus prepare the business \\nfor the future environment in which we will operate. \\nDuring 2018 we developed and piloted an approach to assess the impact \\nof climate change on our key commodities. We selected soy for this pilot based on its importance to Unilever (large purchased volume), it being a high-profile crop in the countries where it is grown and the availability of good historical price data and suitable climate models. \\nWe developed a methodology which combined forecasting future \\nyields and quantifying the impact on commodity prices of soybean oil. Climate change was the only price factor accounted for in the model used to calculate the impact. Other factors which impact price, such as technology and acreage, were excluded. The model considered the direct risks from climate change to the price of soybean oil, such as change in yield and change in supply. Three modelling steps were performed: • Yield estimation: We analysed multiple agriculture and climate \\nmodels to provide a forecast range of expected yields in key growing regions. \\n• Price relationship: An econometric model was developed, based \\non an analysis of the soybean oil market and historical trends, to estimate the impact of climate-induced yield changes on future prices. This model considered the importance of co-products eg soybean meal, substitution potential eg with sunflower oil and industrial uses of soybean oil, as well as the impact of yield on price. \\n• Impact estimation: Future yields and price impacts were then \\ntranslated into an estimated financial exposure from climate change for our business, using our forecast procurement volumes. \\nOur pilot analysis showed that soybean yields may increase over', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",

While the results may indicate a low financial risk \\nto our business, we would need to consider a wider range of risk factors when determining our strategic response. Indirect risks from climate change, such as catastrophic events or external policy \\nresponse and adaptation could also have an impact but were not \\nincluded in our modelling. Furthermore, these pilot results are specific to soy and can’t be applied to other crops. We have therefore \\ndecided to get broader understanding on the climate change risks to our agricultural sourcing and extend our analysis to two other important crops to Unilever: Palm Oil and Tea, for which suitable \\nclimate change models for yield predictions will be available in 2019. \\nRESPONDING TO RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES \\nUnilever’s vision is to grow our business whilst decoupling our growth \\nfrom our environmental footprint and increasing positive social impact. This vision explicitly recognises that sustainable growth – including management of climate-related risks and opportunities – is the only \\nway to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. \\nThe Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) was developed to deliver \\nour vision. It is fully integrated with our business strategy. Climate-related issues are integral to the USLP. Two of our GHG reduction targets included in the USLP are recognised as science-based: • Halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the \\nlifecycle by 2030 (this target covers all the phases across the lifecycle of our products: ingredients/raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, retail, packaging, consumer use and disposal) \\n• Reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 100% from \\nour own operations by 2030 (this is part of our ambition to be become carbon positive in our manufacturing by 2030) \\nWe are taking action across our value chain to reduce our emissions, \\ncreating growth opportunities and minimising risk. Our commitment to source 100% of our palm oil from sustainable sources is helping to avoid emissions from deforestation (see pages 14 and 47). Our efforts to reduce energy and GHG emissions in manufacturing are helping us to save costs. For example, by using less energy, we have already avoided energy costs in our factories of over €600 million since our baseline year of 2008. \\nOur divisions are taking action to reduce emissions. In Home Care we \\nare focusing on concentrated liquid laundry detergents such as Persil, Omo and Surf Small & Mighty which help consumers to wash clothes \\nat lower temperatures, reducing GHG by up to 50% per load. We have \\nremoved phosphates from all laundry powders worldwide, resulting in \\nlower greenhouse gas emissions of up to 50% per consumer use. Our \\nFoods & Refreshment division has prioritised reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ice cream freezers since 2008. As the world’s \\nlargest producer of ice cream, we have committed to accelerating the \\nroll-out of freezer cabinets that use more climate-friendly natural \\n(hydrocarbon) refrigerants. By 2018 our total purchase of these \\ncabinets had increased to around 2.9 million. \\nDetailed Lifecycle Analysis has shown that our GHG contribution from \\nanimal-based agriculture, including fats and proteins, is relatively \\nlow: 7.5% for Foods & Refreshment and 2.5% for total Unilever. \\nWhile emissions are comparatively low, the business opportunity is \\nsignificant for natural and plant-based foods and beverages. We have a range of vegan and vegetarian variants such as Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise, Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy ice creams, Magnum vegan and \\nother options (see pages 11 to 12). We continue to actively promote', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"other options (see pages 11 to 12). We continue to actively promote \\nvegetarian and vegan recipes, notably via our Knorr brand websites. \\nA number of our targets directly address risks and opportunities \\nrelated to water scarcity caused by climate change. We estimate \\nthat the sale of products which address water scarcity issues could \\nincrease in our Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care divisions where a number of products are available which address water scarcity and/ or have a lower GHG in use. For example, our Beauty & Personal Care \\ndivision is investing in water smart product innovations such as dry \\nshampoo and cleansing conditioner which help consumers use less \\nwater while also offering relevant benefits such as reduced colour loss and damage which can arise from frequent washing. Home Care is combining insights in consumer behaviour and water consumption \\nwith innovative technology to develop new market opportunities, \\nlaunching products and formulations that address water scarcity \\nand help our consumers save water. Day2, the world's first dry wash spray is made with only 0.02% of the water in a normal laundry load. Sunlight 2-in-1 Handwashing Laundry Powder and Rin (Radiant) \\ndetergent bar are also helping to reduce water consumption at point \\nof use in water-stressed countries.

       " Document(page_content='Home Care is home to three brands, Pureit, Truliva/Qinyuan and Blueair, \\nwhich are responding directly to issues related to climate change. Pureit and Truliva, our water purification businesses, offer products which provide safe drinking water to millions of people with a lower carbon \\nfootprint than alternatives. Our detailed lifecycle analysis shows that \\nPureit’s total carbon footprint is at least 80% lower than boiled or bottled \\nwater. Blueair, our indoor air purification business acquired in 2016, removes contaminants from the air, including hazardous sooty particles associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. \\nSeveral other targets in our USLP indirectly address climate risk and \\nopportunities by aiming to support groups who are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and who are critical to our future growth, \\nnotably smallholder farmers and women in low income countries. \\nUnilever continues to support a number of policy measures to \\naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, including the \\npricing of carbon and removal of fossil fuel subsidies which act as negative carbon prices. We believe that carbon pricing is a fundamental part of the global response to climate change and \\nwithout it, the world is unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas reduction \\ntargets. We have publicly supported calls for carbon pricing and are \\nmembers of The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, hosted by the World Bank. In 2016, we implemented an internal price on carbon as part of the business case appraisal for large capital expenditure \\nprojects. The carbon price is also applied to emissions from our \\nmanufacturing sites to raise a clean-tech fund. So far, €73 million \\nhas been allocated to this fund for energy and water saving projects. In January 2018 the price of carbon was €40 per tonne. \\nMEASURING AND REPORTING \\nWe have been measuring and reporting on our energy and water consumption and carbon emissions since 1995. The USLP includes a number of stretching targets which relate to climate risks and opportunities across our value chain. Performance against key targets can be found on page 7 with commentary on page 13 and 14. Our website contains detailed commentary on our USLP targets as well as actions we are taking to achieve them. \\nOur ability to meet our climate-related targets partly depends on \\nchanges in the energy markets worldwide, such as the rate of installation \\nof renewable electricity in many countries. We have a role to play \\nas an industry leader to help shape those markets. We are working \\ncollaboratively with partners, suppliers and others to achieve our ambition. \\nWe’ve created a detailed plan to annually assess the feasibility for Unilever \\nto reach our target to halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across the lifecycle by 2030, taking both external transitions towards a \\nlow-carbon economy as well as the latest available data and assumptions about our GHG footprint into account. The basis of this plan is the set of \\naround 2,800 products representative of our global portfolio across all \\ndivisions for which we have full value-chain lifecycle analysis results. \\nWe recalculated the footprint of these products using the latest 2030 \\nprojections on external transitions to a low-carbon economy (eg International Energy Agency 2030 projection on grid changes to renewable energy), low-carbon transition plans in our operations (eg achieving zero net deforestation by 2020, using 100% renewable energy by 2020) and Innovation Roadmaps (eg redesign for lower embedded carbon emissions, \\ntransforming the temperature-controlled supply chain). \\nIn line with the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups \\n(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended by the Companies \\nAct 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 our', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='GOVERNANCE REPORT \\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \\nUNILEVER’S STRUCTURE \\nSince its formation in 1930, the Unilever Group has operated as nearly \\nas practicable as a single economic entity. This is achieved by special provisions in the Articles of Association of NV and PLC, together with a series of agreements between NV and PLC which are together known as the Foundation Agreements (described below). These agreements enable Unilever to achieve unity of management, operations, shareholders’ rights, purpose and mission and can be found on our website. \\nThe Equalisation Agreement makes the economic position of the \\nshareholders of NV and PLC, as far as possible, the same as if they held shares in a single company and also regulates the mutual rights of the shareholders of NV* and PLC. Under this agreement, NV and \\nPLC must adopt the same financial periods and accounting policies. \\nThe Deed of Mutual Covenants provides that NV and PLC and their \\nrespective subsidiary companies shall co-operate in every way for the purpose of maintaining a common operating policy. They shall exchange all relevant information about their respective businesses – the intention being to create and maintain a common operating platform for the Unilever Group throughout the world. This Deed also contains provisions for the allocation of assets within the Unilever Group. \\nUnder the Agreement for Mutual Guarantees of Borrowing between \\nNV and PLC, each company will, if asked by the other, guarantee \\nthe borrowings of the other and the other’s subsidiaries. These \\narrangements are used, as a matter of financial policy, for certain \\nsignificant borrowings. They enable lenders to rely on our combined financial strength. \\nEach NV ordinary share represents the same underlying economic \\ninterest in the Unilever Group as each PLC ordinary share. However, NV and PLC remain separate legal entities with different shareholder constituencies and separate stock exchange listings. Shareholders cannot convert or exchange the shares of one for the shares of the other. More information on the exercise of voting rights can be found in NV’s and PLC’s Articles of Association and in the Notices of Meetings for our NV and PLC AGMs, all of which can be found on our website. \\n* Throughout this report, when referring to NV shares or shareholders, the \\nterm ‘shares’ or ‘shareholder’ also encompasses a depositary receipt or \\na holder of depositary receipts. \\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporate\\xad\\ngovernance/legal-structure-and-foundation-agreements/ \\nBOARDS \\nThe Boards of NV and PLC have ultimate responsibility for the \\nmanagement, general affairs, direction, performance and long-term \\nsuccess of our business as a whole. The Boards are one-tier boards, \\nthe same people are on both Boards and the responsibility of the \\nDirectors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The majority of the Directors are Non-Executive Directors who essentially have \\na supervisory role. In the normal course Unilever has two Executive \\nDirectors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial \\nOfficer (CFO). On 31 December 2018 the current CEO resigned and his \\nsuccessor, Alan Jope, was appointed on 1 January 2019. Alan will be \\nproposed to be appointed as an Executive Director at the 2019 AGMs. \\nConsequently, between 1 January 2019 and the 2019 AGMs in May we \\nhave one Executive Director. A list of our current Directors, their roles on the Boards, their dates of appointment, tenure and their other major appointments is set \\nout on page 3. \\nThe Boards have delegated the operational running of the Unilever \\nGroup to the CEO with the exception of the following matters which are reserved for the Boards: structural and constitutional matters, corporate governance, approval of dividends, approval and monitoring', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",

The CEO is responsible to the Boards in relation to the operational running of the Group and other powers delegated to him by the Boards. The CEO can delegate any of his powers and discretions, and he does so delegate to members of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) (with power to sub-delegate). The ULE is composed of the CEO, CFO and other senior executives who assist the CEO in the discharge of the powers delegated to the CEO by the Boards. Members of the ULE report to the CEO, and the CEO supervises and determines the roles, activities and responsibilities of the ULE. While ULE members (other than the CEO and the CFO) are not part of the Boards’ decision-making process, to provide the Boards with deeper insights, ULE members often attend those parts of the Board meetings which relate to the operational running of the Group. The ULE currently consists of the CEO, CFO, the Division Presidents, the Presidents for Europe and North America, and the Chief Research and Development Officer, Chief HR Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer and Chief Supply Chain Officer. \\nThe biographies of ULE members are on page 5. \\nBOARD COMMITTEES \\nThe Boards have established four Board Committees: the Audit \\nCommittee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Other ad hoc Board meetings are convened to discuss strategic, transactional and governance matters that arise. In 2018 the Boards met physically in January, March, May, July, October and November. Meetings of the Boards may be held either in London or in Rotterdam or such other locations as the Boards think fit, with one or two off-site Board meetings a year. The Chairman sets the Boards’ agenda, ensures the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, and promotes effective relationships and open communication between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. \\nATTENDANCE \\nThe table showing the attendance of current Directors at Board meetings in 2018 can be found on page 3. If Directors are unable to attend a Board meeting they have the opportunity beforehand to discuss any agenda items with the Chairman. Ann Fudge attended four of the Board meetings she was eligible to attend before retiring from the Boards on 3 May 2018. \\nNON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MEETINGS \\nThe Non-Executive Directors usually meet as a group, without the Executive Directors present, when there is a face-to-face Board meeting. In 2018 they met five times. The Chairman, or in his absence the Senior Independent Director/Vice-Chairman, chairs such meetings. \\nBOARD EVALUATION \\nEach year the Boards formally assess their own performance with \\nthe aim of helping to improve the effectiveness of both the Boards \\nand the Committees. At least once every three years an independent third party facilitates the evaluation. The last external evaluation was \\nperformed in 2017. The evaluation consists of individual interviews \\nwith the Directors by the Chairman and, when relevant, by the external \\nevaluator. These interviews are complemented by the completion by \\nall Directors of three confidential online evaluation questionnaires on the efficiency and effectiveness of our Boards, CEO and Chairman. \\nThe Boards evaluation questionnaire this year focused on a number \\nof key areas including Strategy, Risk/Financial Controls, Board \\nEffectiveness and Information/Knowledge. The Chairman's statement \\non page 2 describes the key actions agreed by the Boards following \\nthe evaluation. \\nThe evaluation of the performance of the Chairman and CEO is led \\nby the Senior Independent Director/Vice-Chairman and Chairman \\nrespectively, and the bespoke questionnaires will be used to support \\nthese evaluations.

The report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCGC) on pages 48 and 49 describes the work of the NCGC in Board appointments and recommendations for re-election. In addition, shareholders are able to nominate Directors. The procedure for \\nshareholders to nominate Directors is contained within the document \\nentitled ‘Appointment procedure for NV and PLC Directors’ which is \\navailable on our website. To do so they must put a resolution to both the NV and PLC AGMs in line with local requirements. Directors are appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at each AGM. \\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporate\\xad\\ngovernance/board-and-management-committees/ \\nDIRECTOR INDUCTION AND TRAINING \\nAll new Directors participate in a comprehensive induction programme \\nwhen they join the Boards. The Chairman ensures that ongoing \\ntraining is provided for Directors by way of site visits, presentations and circulated updates at (and between) Board and Board Committee meetings on, among other things, Unilever’s business, environmental, \\nsocial, corporate governance, regulatory developments and investor \\nrelations matters. For example, in 2018 the Directors received \\npresentations on Information Security, Digital, the Supply Chain and Simplification. \\nINDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICTS \\nAs the Non-Executive Directors make up the Committees of the Boards, it is important that they can be considered to be independent. Each year the Boards conduct a thorough review of the Non-Executive \\nDirectors’, and their related or connected persons’, relevant relationships \\nreferencing the criteria set out in ‘The Governance of Unilever’ \\nwhich is derived from the relevant best practice guidelines in the \\nNetherlands, UK and US. The Boards currently consider all our Non-Executive Directors to be independent of Unilever. \\nWe attach special importance to avoiding conflicts of interest between \\nNV and PLC and their respective Directors. The Boards ensure that \\nthere are effective procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest \\nby Board members. A Director must without delay report any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the Chairman and to the other Directors, or, in case any conflict of interest or potential conflict \\nof interest of the Chairman, to the Senior Independent Director/Vice-\\nChairman and to the other Directors. The Director in question must \\nprovide all relevant information to the Boards, so that the Boards can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant \\nlaws. A Director may not vote on, or be counted in a quorum in relation \\nto, any resolution of the Boards in respect of any situation in which he \\nor she has a conflict of interest. The procedures that Unilever has put in place to deal with conflicts of interest operate effectively. \\nUnilever recognises the benefit to the individual and the Unilever \\nGroup of senior executives acting as directors of other companies but, to ensure outside directorships of our Executive Directors do not involve an excessive commitment or conflict of interest, the number \\nof outside directorships of listed companies is generally limited to one \\nper Executive Director and approval is required from the Chairman. \\nINDEMNIFICATION \\nThe terms of NV Directors’ indemnification are provided for in NV’s \\nArticles of Association.

Their reports included audit and accounting matters, governance and control, and accounting developments. \\nThe Committee held independent meetings with the external auditors \\nduring the year and reviewed, agreed, discussed and challenged their audit plan, including their assessment of the financial reporting risk profile of the Group. The Committee discussed the views and conclusions of KPMG regarding management’s treatment of significant transactions and areas of judgement during the year. The Committee considered these views and comments and is satisfied with the treatment in the financial statements. \\nEXTERNAL AUDITORS \\nKPMG have been the Group’s auditors since 2014 and shareholders approved their re-appointment as the Group’s external auditors at the 2018 AGMs. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Directors will be proposing the re-appointment of KPMG at the AGMs in May 2019. \\nBoth Unilever and KPMG have safeguards in place to avoid the \\npossibility that the external auditors’ objectivity and independence could be compromised, such as audit partner rotation and the restriction on non-audit services that the external auditors can perform as described below. Both the KPMG partners with overall responsibility for the audit of NV and PLC will rotate off the assignment after completion of the 2018 year-end financial statements. One of the new partners already has experience of the Unilever global audit, and the other partner underwent an induction programme through much of this year-end to ensure a smooth transition. KPMG has issued a formal letter to the Committee outlining the general procedures to safeguard independence and objectivity, disclosing the relationship with the Company and confirming their audit independence. \\nEach year, the Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external \\naudit process which includes discussing feedback from the members of the Committee and stakeholders at all levels across Unilever. Interviews are also held with key senior management within both Unilever and KPMG. \\nThe Committee also reviewed the statutory audit, audit related and \\nnon-audit related services provided by KPMG and compliance with Unilever’s documented approach, which prescribes in detail the types of engagements, listed below, for which the external auditors can be used: • statutory audit services, including audit of subsidiaries; • audit related engagements – services that involve attestation, \\nassurance or certification of factual information that may be required by external parties; \\n• non-audit related services – work that our external auditors', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

The Committee further approved all engagements below these levels which have been authorised by the EVP Financial Control, Risk Management, Pension & Sustainability. These authorities are reviewed regularly and, where necessary, updated in the light of internal developments, external developments and best practice. Since the appointment of KPMG in 2014 to 2016 the level of non-audit fees has been below 7% of the annual audit fee. In 2017 and 2018 the level of non-audit fees has been higher at 41% and 31% respectively due to assurance work relating to the disposal of our Spreads business and the Simplification project. \\nThe Committee confirms that the Group is in compliance with The \\nStatutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.

The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2018. While overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, the Committee agreed that to further enhance its effectiveness it needed to ensure the Committee members continued to develop their knowledge of the Group’s operations which would involve further knowledge sessions and site visits. \\nJohn Rishton \\nChair of the Audit Committee \\nNils Andersen \\nJudith Hartmann \\n45 \\nGovernance Report Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"SAFETY \\nSustainable growth is only achieved if Unilever also grows responsibly \\n– by providing safe, high quality products, and protecting employees and the people and communities in which it operates. Safe and high quality products are one of Unilever's principal risks, see page 31. \\nOccupational safety continues to be the personal and everyday responsibility \\nof all those working at Unilever. Reducing Unilever’s Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) is also a target within the USLP. In 2018 TRFR continued to decrease – from 0.89 accidents per 1 million hours worked in 2017 to 0.69 in 2018 (measured 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018). \\nIn factories, Unilever’s World Class Manufacturing programme \\nhardwires safety into all aspects of the production process – by enabling good design principles, engineering and operating practices to be applied from the start of any project. This focus drove a reduction of 39.5% in process safety incidents in 2018. Capacity building and leadership also improved safety for contractors (those who work on Unilever sites under the direct supervision of their own management), reducing their recordable injuries by half 51% over 2014-2018 (measured by Lost-Time Injuries Frequency Rate, LTIFR). \\nUnilever’s approach to product safety is based on risk identification \\nand mitigation. This approach covers all aspects of the value chain – from development, sourcing, manufacture and transport to consumer use and disposal of the product – and is centred on the application of rigorous standards based on sound science and the principle of Safe by Design and Safe in Execution. Thanks to a strong focus on product quality, a significant improvement was achieved in 2018 with potentially serious marketplace incidents reduced by 40%. Over 2017-2018, potentially serious marketplace incidents originating in manufacturing have been reduced by 88% and those originating in suppliers of raw and packing materials have been halved. \\nHUMAN RIGHTS \\nBy addressing strategic human rights issues and helping the business tackle and prevent endemic abuses in global value chains, Unilever is seeking to deliver a positive social impact alongside business growth. \\nUnilever’s human rights aims are part of the Enhancing Livelihoods \\ngoal of the USLP and human rights are included within the company's sustainability and ethical risks. See pages 29 and 33. \\nIn 2018 Unilever continued to embed human rights with a focus on its \\neight salient issues (ie those at risk of the most severe negative impact through Unilever’s activities or business relationships). These are set out in Unilever’s Human Rights Report 2017, with an update on further progress at the end of 2018. The Committee noted that Unilever’s approach to this work is sophisticated and that while there is still much to do, it is making good progress in this complex field. See page 14 for more. \\nPALM OIL \\nPalm oil is one of Unilever’s most significant raw materials and Unilever is one of the world’s major buyers of palm oil. Alongside sustainability and supply chain, Unilever has identified climate change as one of its principal risks (see page [29]) and is committed to eliminating the deforestation associated with unsustainable palm oil production. Securing supplies of sustainable palm oil is therefore a critical element in Unilever’s business and climate strategy and represents a significant target in the USLP. \\nThe Committee was briefed on plans for driving transformational\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The Committee was briefed on plans for driving transformational \\nchange in the palm oil sector. Unilever’s Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy has a focus on the implementation of No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation of people or communities (NDPE) commitments by 2020. However, implementation and enforcement remain challenging. To support the transformation of the sector and the implementation of its Policy, Unilever is investing in multiple initiatives. One example is the &Green Fund which is designed to kick-start investments in deforestation-free agriculture in countries that are working to reduce deforestation and peat degradation. Unilever was announced as the first investor. The Fund aims to protect over 5 million hectares of forest and peatlands by 2020, by de-risking private capital investments into large-scale deforestation-free production, protection and inclusion initiatives. With an aim to trigger $1.6 billion in private capital investments, the Fund is an opportunity to jointly shape solutions to mitigate deforestation and a good illustration of the collaborative, transformational approaches the company is seeking to scale. To promote transparency and traceability of palm oil sourcing, in 2018 Unilever was also the first consumer goods company to publish the names of its suppliers and a map of the 1,400 palm oil mills in its extended supply chain on its website. This was accompanied by a more visible grievance mechanism to facilitate the reporting of issues of non-compliance in the supply chain. \\nAnother important step was an industry-first partnership with \\nIndonesian government-owned palm oil plantation company PT Perkebunan Nusantara (PTPN). The partnership is designed to support local mills and smallholder farmers to produce palm oil according to the NDPE standards that are key to multi-sector efforts to transform the palm oil industry. \\nPACKAGING WASTE \\nPackaging waste, particularly post-consumer plastic packaging waste in oceans and waterways, has never been higher on the global agenda than in 2018. Plastic packaging now sits alongside climate change as a major environmental challenge and is identified as a risk for Unilever's business, see page 30. \\nUnilever has reduced the waste associated with the disposal of its \\nproducts by 31% since 2010 (measured as impact per consumer use, towards a target of 50%) and is making strong progress in its own operations and product design. However, the challenge for post-consumer waste is in having the right infrastructure in place to ensure materials are collected and processed, while encouraging consumers to segregate and recycle them. \\nTo support its specific, time-bound targets, at the beginning of 2018 \\nUnilever introduced a new three-part framework designed to sharpen thinking on plastic packaging and innovation: i) Less Plastic means using lighter, stronger and better materials which have a lower environmental impact; ii) Better Plastic entails eliminating problematic materials and using recyclable plastics with a minimum 25% recycled content; iii) No Plastic involves using alternative materials, new packaging formats and alternative models of consumption such as vending – to help reduce use of single-use plastics through innovation, behaviour change and new business models. See page 15 for more. \\nMCIP \\nUnilever’s Reward Framework includes the Management Co-investment Plan (MCIP), a long-term incentive plan that is linked to financial and USLP performance (see page 53). Corporate Responsibility Committee members shared their views on the context and progress of the USLP and sustainability initiatives with the Compensation Committee to help inform its recommendation on MCIP. \\nEVALUATION OF THE CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY \\nCOMMITTEE \\nAs part of the internal board evaluation carried out in 2018, the Boards\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

This goes right through our organisation, starting with the Boards. Unilever’s Board Diversity Policy, which is reviewed by the Committee each year, is reflected on our website at www.unilever .com/boardsofunilever. The Boards feel that, while gender and ethnicity are an important part of diversity, Unilever Directors will continue to be selected on the basis of their wide-ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight. \\nIn 2018 the Committee also reviewed and considered relevant \\nrecommendations on diversity and remains pleased that 45% of our Non-Executive Directors are women and that there are nine nationalities represented on the Boards. \\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENTS \\nThe Committee reviews relevant proposed legislation and changes to relevant corporate governance codes at least twice a year.

The subset of UK and Dutch management has been used as a fair representation of our dual listing status. \\n% change from 2017 to 2018 Fixed Pay Bonus Other benefits \\n(not including \\npension) \\nCEO(a)(b) 11.3% -16.5% -19.2% \\nCFO(a)(c) 8.2% -10.5% 8.3% \\nUK and Dutch management(d) 8.0% 4.9% -0.2% \\n(a) Calculated using the data from the Executive Directors’ single figure table on page 54 (for information on exchange rates please see the footnotes in that table). \\n(b) The CEO Fixed Pay and other benefits figures reflect the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including the consolidation of conditional \\nsupplemental pension accrual into Fixed Pay from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates. The reduction in benefits value is also due to variations in charges for social security and tax return preparation fees, both of which decreased in 2018. \\n(c) The increase in Fixed Pay shown for the CFO reflects the implementation of our new Reward Framework in 2018, including a 5% increase in Fixed Pay with \\neffect from the 2018 AGMs, and changes in the relevant sterling:euro exchange rates. The increase in benefits value is due to an increase in private medical insurance costs. \\n(d) For the UK and Dutch management population, Fixed Pay numbers have been restated to include cash-related benefits employees receive as part of their total \\ncompensation, to ensure we can accurately compare Fixed Pay for the management population against that of the CEO and CFO. Figures are also affected by changes in the average sterling:euro exchange rates for 2017 and 2018, as well as a lower bonus performance ratio in 2018 compared to 2017. \\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTORS (CEO/CFO) PAY RATIO COMPARISON \\nThe table below shows how pay for the CEO compares to our UK employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. \\nYear 25th Percentile Median Percentile 75th Percentile Mean Pay Ratio \\nYear ending 31 December 2018 Salary: £28,804 £37,000 £50,021 \\nPay and benefits \\n(excluding pension): £34,400 £41,443 £57,800 \\nPay ratio (Option A): 301 250 179 147 \\nFigures for the CEO are calculated using the data from the Executive Directors’ single figure table on page 54 (where relevant, translated into pounds using the average exchange rate over 2018 (€1 = £0.8835)). \\nOption A was used to calculate the pay and benefits (excluding pension) of the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile UK employees because \\nthe data was readily available for all UK employees of the group and Option A is the most accurate method (as it is based on total full-time \\nequivalent total reward for all UK employees for the relevant financial year).

The Committee’s revised terms of reference are contained within ‘The Governance \\nof Unilever’, and are also set out on our website. \\nwww.unilever.com/investor-relations/agm-and-corporate-governance/ \\nAs part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2018, the Boards evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2018. While overall the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively, the Committee has agreed to further enhance its effectiveness by monitoring the responsiveness of the Reward Framework to rapidly evolving market conditions and adding a finance briefing session on the continued appropriateness of performance measures for incentive plans. \\nADVISERS \\nWhile it is the Committee’s responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment. \\nTom Gosling of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) provided the Committee with independent advice on various matters it considered. During 2018, \\nthe wider PwC firm has also provided tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance, transfer pricing, other tax-related services, contract compliance reviews, internal audit advice and secondees, third-party risk and compliance advice, cyber security advice, sustainability assurance and consulting; PwC has also been assisting with financial due diligence on M&A transactions undertaken by the Unilever Group. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available online. \\nwww.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com (Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting) \\nThe Committee is satisfied that the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Unilever N.V. or Unilever PLC that might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2018 were £146,650. This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed. \\nDuring the year, the Committee also sought input from the CEO (Paul Polman), the Chief Human Resources Officer (Leena Nair) and the EVP \\nGlobal Head of Reward (Peter Newhouse) on various subjects including the remuneration of senior management. No individual Executive \\nDirector was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure a conflict of interest did not arise, although the Committee \\nhas separately sought and obtained Executive Directors’ own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before \\nrecommending individual packages to the Boards for approval. The Committee also received legal and governance advice from the Chief Legal \\nOfficer and Group Secretary (Ritva Sotamaa) and the General Counsel – Executive Remuneration & Employment (Margot Fransen). \\nSHAREHOLDER VOTING \\nUnilever remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes.

ACCOUNTING INFORMATION AND POLICIES \\nThe accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were \\napplied for the previous financial year, except as set out below under the heading ‘Recent accounting developments’. \\nUNILEVER \\nThe two parent companies, NV and PLC, together with their group companies, operate as a single economic entity (the Unilever Group, \\nalso referred to as Unilever or the Group). NV and PLC have the same \\nDirectors and are linked by a series of agreements, including an \\nEqualisation Agreement, which are designed so that the positions of \\nthe shareholders of both companies are as closely as possible the \\nsame as if they held shares in a single company. \\nThe Equalisation Agreement provides that both companies adopt the \\nsame accounting principles. It also requires that dividends and other \\nrights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of NV, be equal in value to those rights and benefits attaching to each ordinary share of PLC, as if each such unit of capital formed part of the ordinary share capital of one and the same company. \\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION \\nDue to the operational and contractual arrangements referred to above, NV and PLC form a single reporting entity for the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements of Unilever are presented by both NV and PLC as their respective consolidated financial statements. Group companies included in the consolidation are those companies controlled by NV or PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment. \\nThe net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in \\nthe consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. The results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases. \\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated. \\nCOMPANIES LEGISLATION AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), IFRIC Interpretations and in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Civil Code in the Netherlands and the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They are also in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). \\nThese financial statements are prepared under the historical cost \\nconvention unless otherwise indicated. \\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern \\nbasis. Refer to the going concern statement on page 66. \\nACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nAccounting policies are included in the relevant notes to the \\nconsolidated financial statements. These are presented as text \\nhighlighted in grey on pages 79 to 127. The accounting policies below \\nare applied throughout the financial statements. \\nFOREIGN CURRENCIES \\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. The functional currencies of NV and PLC are euros and sterling respectively. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. \\nForeign currency transactions in individual group companies are \\ntranslated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the balances \\nin individual group companies are translated from their functional currency into euros. Apart from the financial statements of group \\ncompanies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income \\nstatement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for \\nthe transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. \\nAssets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. \\nThe financial statements of group companies whose functional currency \\nis the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation \\nand then translated into euros. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years. \\nThe ordinary share capital of NV and PLC is translated in accordance \\nwith the Equalisation Agreement. The difference between the value for \\nPLC and the value by applying the year-end rate of exchange is taken to other reserves (see note 15B on page 106). \\nThe effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of \\nforeign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose net assets \\ninclude loans between group companies and any related foreign \\nexchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. \\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences \\narising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and NV or PLC as appropriate, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective. \\nCumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition \\nto IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of \\nother reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest \\nin a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of \\ncapital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies. \\nCLASSIFICATION OF ARGENTINA AS \\nA HYPER-INFLATIONARY ECONOMY \\nThe Argentinian economy was designated as hyperinflationary from \\n1 July 2018. As a result, application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ has been applied to all Unilever entities whose functional currency is the Argentinian Peso. IAS 29 requires that adjustments are applicable from the start of the relevant entity’s reporting period. For Unilever that is from 1 January 2018. The application of IAS 29 includes: • Adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for \\nthe change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date; \\n• Adjustment of the income statement for inflation during the \\nreporting period; \\n• The income statement is translated at the period end foreign \\nexchange rate instead of an average rate; and \\n• Adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of \\ninflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency. \\nThe main effects on the Group consolidated financial statements for 2018 are: • Total assets increased by €538 million driven by an increase of €369 \\nmillion to goodwill (see note 9) and €171 million due to property, plant and equipment (see note 10); \\n• Opening retained profit increased by €393 million reflecting the', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 81}),\n",

No impairments were identified except for the Blueair \\nintangibles. The Blueair acquisition included an element of deferred consideration payable in 2021. The terms relating to this element allowed the \\nsellers to request an early settlement for a reduced sum. Such a request was made in 2018 and the payment was made to the sellers, reducing \\nthe consideration payable by €277 million and generating a credit in non-underlying items within the line ‘acquisition & disposal related costs’. \\nThis early termination has been considered as a trigger event for an impairment review for Blueair intangible assets and a €208 million charge \\nhas been recognised in non-underlying items within the line ‘impairments and other one-off items’ (see note 3) \\nSIGNIFICANT CGUS \\nThe goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the CGUs relating to Foods & Refreshment Europe, Foods & Refreshment The Americas, \\nBeauty & Personal Care The Americas and Beauty & Personal Care Asia/AMET/RUB are considered significant within the total carrying amounts of \\ngoodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets at 31 December 2018 in terms of size, headroom and sensitivity to assumptions used. \\nThe goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets held in the significant CGUs are: \\n€ billion € billion \\n2018 CGUs Goodwill Indefinite-life \\nintangible \\nassets \\nFoods & Refreshment Europe 3.9 1.6 \\nFoods & Refreshment The Americas 3.9 2.1 \\nBeauty & Personal Care The Americas 4.0 2.8 \\nBeauty & Personal Care Asia/AMET/RUB 1.7 2.0 \\n€ billion € billion \\n2017 CGUs Goodwill Indefinite-life \\nintangible assets \\nFoods (excluding spreads) Europe 4.5 1.6 \\nFoods (excluding spreads) The Americas 2.8 1.4 \\nFoods (excluding spreads) Asia/AMET/RUB 1.5 0.4 \\nBeauty & Personal Care The Americas 2.5 1.5 \\nIn 2017 the global spreads CGU was also considered significant, with a carrying value of €2,228 million in goodwill and €82 million in indefinite-\\nlife intangible assets. These were classified as assets held for sale. \\nValue in use has been calculated as the present value of projected cash flows. A pre-tax discount rate of 7.4% (2017: 7.4%) was used. \\nFor the significant CGUs, the following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash flow projections: \\nFoods & \\nRefreshment Foods & \\nRefreshment Beauty & \\nPersonal Care Beauty & \\nPersonal Care \\nEurope The Americas The \\nAmericas Asia/ \\nAMET/RUB \\nLonger-term sustainable growth rates 1.2% 1.6% 1.6% 3.8% \\nAverage near-term nominal growth rates 0.0% 0.7% 2.8% 3.9% \\nAverage operating margins 16% 15% 20% 22% \\nThe projections cover a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual \\nperformances before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows. \\nThe growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on the conservative end of the range of estimates from past \\nperformance, our annual forecast and three year strategic plan extended to year 4 and 5. \\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions.

CAPITAL AND FUNDING  CONTINUED \\nKey instruments used by the treasury department are: • short-term and long-term borrowings; • cash and cash equivalents; and • plain vanilla derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. \\nThe Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief \\nFinancial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted. \\nUnilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital: \\n• total equity – retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests (notes 15A and 15B); • short-term debt – current financial liabilities (note 15C); and • long-term debt – non-current financial liabilities (note 15C). \\nThe Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through \\nan appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group is based on management’s judgement of the appropriate balance of \\nkey elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital \\nstructure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. \\nOur current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we \\nconsider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with: • appropriate access to the debt and equity markets; • sufficient flexibility for acquisitions; • sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and • optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints. \\nUnilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING CONTINUED \\nMASTER NETTING OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS \\nA number of legal entities within our Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master \\nnetting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. \\nThe ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because \\nthe Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, between various Group and bank affiliates, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future credit events such as a default. \\nThe column ‘Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet – Financial instruments’ shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, \\nassuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction. \\n(I) FINANCIAL ASSETS \\nThe following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements. \\nRelated amounts not set \\noff in the balance sheet \\n€ million € million € million € million € million € million \\nAs at 31 December 2018 Gross \\namounts of \\nrecognised \\nfinancial \\nassets Gross \\namounts of \\nrecognised \\nfinancial \\nassets set \\noff in the \\nbalance \\nsheet Net amounts \\nof financial \\nassets \\npresented \\nin the \\nbalance \\nsheet Financial \\ninstruments Cash \\ncollateral \\nreceived Net amount \\nDerivative financial assets  339 (63)  276 (164)  (10)  102 \\nAs at 31 December 2017 \\nDerivative financial assets 276 (103) 173 (108) (6) 59 \\n(II) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES \\nThe following financial liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements. \\nRelated amounts not set \\noff in the balance sheet \\n€ million € million € million € million € million € million \\nAs at 31 December 2018 Gross \\namounts of \\nrecognised \\nfinancial \\nliabilities Gross \\namounts of \\nrecognised \\nfinancial \\nliabilities set \\noff in the \\nbalance \\nsheet Net amounts \\nof financial \\nliabilities \\npresented \\nin the \\nbalance \\nsheet Financial \\ninstruments Cash \\ncollateral \\npledged Net amount \\nDerivative financial liabilities  (605)  63 (542)  164 –  (378) \\nAs at 31 December 2017 \\nDerivative financial liabilities (637) 103 (534) 108 – (426) \\n115 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 117}),\n",

They do not include commitments to \\npurchase property, plant and equipment, which are reported in note 10 on pages 100 and 101. \\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES \\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that are not probable. They arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation. In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes. The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil. \\nAssessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known \\nmaximum exposure. In the case of fiscal matters the known maximum exposure is the amount included on a tax assessment. \\n121 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",

(the Company) were prepared \\non the going concern basis and comply in all material respects with legislation in the Netherlands. As allowed by Article 2:362.1 of the Dutch Civil Code, the company accounts are prepared in accordance \\nwith Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure \\nFramework’ (FRS 101), unless such standards conflict with the Dutch Civil Code which would in such case prevail. \\nThe accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except \\nfor the revaluation of financial assets classified as ‘fair value through \\nother comprehensive income’ or ‘fair value through profit or loss’, pension \\nassets, as well as derivative financial instruments, which are reported in \\naccordance with the accounting policies set out below. These have been \\nconsistently applied to all periods presented. \\nUnilever N.V. is included within the consolidated financial statements \\nof the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group \\nare prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union. \\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure \\nexemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based \\npayments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of \\ncomparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash \\nflow statement, impairment of assets, non-current assets held for sale, \\ndiscontinued operations, business combinations, related-party transactions \\nand standards not yet effective. Where required equivalent disclosures are \\ngiven in the group accounts of Unilever, which are available within this report. \\nACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nThe principal accounting policies are as follows: \\nFOREIGN CURRENCY \\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is the euro. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional \\ncurrency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. \\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign \\nexchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that \\nare measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling \\nat the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences \\narising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account (except \\nfor differences arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges, \\nwhich are recognised in other comprehensive income). \\nTURNOVER \\nTurnover excludes value added tax and comprises royalties and service fees \\nreceived from Group companies. Unilever N.V. recognises turnover based \\non the criteria of a full performance of a contract or delivery of services. \\nOPERATING PROFIT/(LOSS) \\nThe operating profit/(loss) is stated after deducting the costs that are \\nmainly related to the royalties and delivered services. Expenses are allocated to the period in which they relate. \\nNET FINANCE COSTS \\nNet finance costs are comprised of finance costs and finance income, including net finance costs in relation to pensions and similar obligations. \\nTAXATION\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"NET FINANCE COSTS \\nNet finance costs are comprised of finance costs and finance income, including net finance costs in relation to pensions and similar obligations. \\nTAXATION \\nUnilever N.V., together with certain of its subsidiaries, is part of a tax grouping for Dutch corporate income tax purposes. Unilever N.V. is the head of the fiscal unity. The members of the fiscal unity are jointly and severally liable for any taxes payable by the Dutch tax grouping. \\nGOODWILL \\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date which is the date at which control was transferred to Unilever. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously-held equity interests less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated losses. Any \\nimpairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. \\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS \\nFinite life intangible assets mainly comprise patented and non-patented \\ntechnology, licences and software including intangible assets acquired from the Group companies. These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceeds 15 years. Indefinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise trademarks and brands. These assets are capitalised at cost but not amortised. They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. \\nINVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES \\nShares in group companies are stated at amortised cost less any amounts written off to reflect impairment. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises. \\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS \\nCash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. \\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nThe Company’s accounting policies are the same as the Unilever Group’s and comply with International Accounting Standard 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (IAS 32), IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The policies are set out under the heading ‘Capital and funding’ in note 15 to the consolidated accounts on page 104. Unilever N.V. is taking the exemption for financial instruments disclosures, because IFRS 7 disclosures are given in notes 15 to 18 to the consolidated accounts on pages 104 to 120. \\nNON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and \\ndebt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, \\nloans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. Trade and other \\nreceivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Trade and other payables \\nare recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they \\nare measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. \\nDEFERRED TAXATION \\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n",

Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: • goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; • the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither \\naccounting nor taxable profit; and \\n• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that \\nthey will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of \\nrealisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end. \\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable \\nthat future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can \\nbe utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no \\nlonger probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. \\n130 \\nFinancial Statements Unilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n",

All differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves. \\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS \\nUnilever N.V. is the sponsoring employer to a number of pension schemes. There are formal agreements in place for how the contributions \\nto be paid are split between participating companies. In line with this \\nstated policy, Unilever N.V. recognises the assets and liabilities of the schemes of which it is a sponsoring employer in full on the NV balance sheet. The recovery of contributions from other employing entities is in \\nline with the existing agreements that are already in place. \\nUnilever N.V. has accounted for pensions and similar benefits under IAS \\n19 ‘Employee Benefits’. The operating and financing costs of defined \\nbenefit plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account; \\nservice costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees; \\nand financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. \\nVariations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans \\nor changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in other \\ncomprehensive income. The costs of individual events such as past benefits, \\nenhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately \\nin the profit and loss account. The liabilities and, where applicable, the \\nassets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance \\nsheet. The charges to the profit and loss account for defined contribution \\nplans are Unilever N.V. contributions payable and the assets of such plans \\nare not included in Unilever N.V.’s balance sheet. \\nPROVISIONS \\nProvisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation \\nexists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable. \\nDIVIDENDS \\nUnder IAS 10 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, proposed dividends do not meet the definition of a liability. Therefore, we do not recognise a liability in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will not \\nbe approved until after the balance sheet date. This holds for external \\ndividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent company. \\nFINANCIAL GUARANTEES \\nWhere the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the \\nCompany considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for \\nthem as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the \\nCompany will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. \\n1.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS \\nUnilever N.V. has issued joint and several liability undertakings, as \\ndefined in Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code, for almost all Dutch group companies. These written undertakings have been filed with the office of the Company Registry in whose area of jurisdiction the group company concerned has its registered office. \\nThe total amount of guarantees, is €17,418 million (2017: €15,426 \\nmillion). This consists mainly of joint guarantees with Unilever PLC and Unilever United States, Inc. relating to the long-term debt and commercial paper issued by Unilever PLC and/or Unilever Capital Corporation Inc. Unilever N.V. also guarantees some borrowings of other group companies and some contingent consideration of group companies relating to past business acquisitions. Other joint guarantees with Unilever PLC relate to derivatives taken out by group companies. \\nAdditionally, Unilever N.V. jointly with Unilever PLC and Unilever United \\nStates, Inc. has guaranteed the standby facilities of $7,865 million \\n(2017: $7,865 million and €4,000 million) which remains undrawn as at \\n31 December 2018 and 2017. \\nUnilever N.V. also has guarantees and financial commitments \\nincluding indemnities arising from past business disposals and for \\ncertain global service contracts. No value can be attributed to these \\nfinancial commitments at this time. \\nThe likelihood of these guarantees, financial commitments and \\ncontingencies being called is considered to be remote and so \\naccordingly the fair value is deemed to be immaterial. 22. PURCHASE OF UNILEVER N.V. PREFERENCE SHARES \\nOn 2 October 2018 Unilever N.V. repurchased the issued and outstanding 6% and 7% preference shares from Unilever Corporate Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever PLC . Consideration paid for the repurchase of preference shares was \\n€450 million. As the preference \\nshares were classified as debt in the balance sheet, the difference between consideration paid and carrying value of the shares of €382 million is recorded within the finance costs in the income statement. \\nThe preference shares were cancelled in February 2019. \\n23.

THE RULES FOR PROFIT APPROPRIATION IN THE \\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION (SUMMARY OF ARTICLE 38) \\nThe profit for the year is applied firstly to the reserves required by law \\nor by the Equalisation Agreement, secondly to cover losses of previous years, if any, and thirdly to the reserves deemed necessary by the Board of Directors. Dividends due to the holders of the preference shares, if any, including any arrears in such dividends, are then paid; if the profit is insufficient for this purpose, the amount available is distributed to them in proportion to the dividend percentages of their shares. Any profit remaining thereafter shall be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their respective holdings of ordinary shares. The General Meeting can only decide to make distributions from reserves on the basis of a proposal by the Board and in compliance with the law and the Equalisation Agreement. \\n27.

The Companies, Partnership and Groups (Accounts and Reports) \\nRegulations 2015 have been adopted from 1 January 2015. No profit \\nand loss account is presented by Unilever PLC (the Company) as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. \\nThe accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, \\nexcept for the revaluation of financial assets classified as ‘fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income’ or ‘fair value through profit or \\nloss’, as well as derivative financial instruments, which are reported \\nin accordance with the accounting policies set out below. These have \\nbeen consistently applied to all periods presented. \\nUnilever PLC is included within the consolidated financial statements \\nof the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group \\nare prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \\nStandards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union. \\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the \\ndisclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to \\nshare based payments, financial instruments, capital management, \\npresentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, \\npresentation of a cash flow statement, impairment of assets, \\nnon-current assets for sale, discontinued operations, business \\ncombinations, related party transactions and standards not yet effective. Where required equivalent disclosures are given in the group \\naccounts of Unilever, which are publicly available. \\nACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nThe principal accounting policies are as follows: \\nFOREIGN CURRENCY \\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is Pound \\nSterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling \\nat the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are \\nretranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are \\ntranslated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. \\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \\nthat are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are \\nrecognised in the profit and loss account. \\nTAXATION \\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the \\nperiod, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods. \\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS \\nFinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise licences. These assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis in the profit and loss account over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceed 15 years. Indefinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise trademarks and brands. These assets are capitalised at cost but not amortised. They are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises. \\nINVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES \\nShares in group companies are stated at amortised cost less any amounts written off to reflect impairment. Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\", metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 137}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Company’s accounting policies are the same as the Unilever Group’s and comply with International Accounting Standard 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (IAS 32), IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The policies are set out under the heading ‘Capital and funding’ in note 15 to the consolidated accounts on pages 104 to 109. Unilever PLC is taking the exemption for financial instruments disclosures, because \\nIFRS 7 disclosures are given in notes 15 to 18 to the consolidated \\naccounts on pages 104 to 120. \\nNON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity \\nand debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash \\nequivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. \\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Trade \\nand other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent \\nto initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. \\nDEFERRED TAXATION \\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable \\ntemporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Company. Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: • the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither \\naccounting nor taxable profit; and \\n• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that \\nthey will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of \\nrealisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end. \\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable \\nthat future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can \\nbe utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. \\nTREASURY SHARES \\nShares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’. All differences between \\nthe purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and \\nthe proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, \\nare charged to reserves. \\nPROVISIONS \\nProvisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation \\nexists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where \\nthe amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the \\noutflow of economic benefit is probable. \\nDIVIDENDS \\nUnder IAS 10 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, proposed dividends \\ndo not meet the definition of a liability. Therefore, we do not recognise a liability in any period for dividends that have been proposed but will not be approved until after the balance sheet date. This holds for \\nexternal dividends as well as intra-group dividends paid to the parent \\ncompany. \\nFINANCIAL GUARANTEES \\nWhere the Company enters in financial guarantee contracts to \\nguarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The average number of employees during 2018 \\nincluded 7,996 seasonal workers. We believe our relationship with our employees and any labour unions of which they may be part is satisfactory in all material respects. \\nGLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS (SHARES) \\nIn November 2014, Unilever’s global employee plan ‘SHARES’ was launched in 17 countries. SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below senior management level the opportunity to invest between €25 and €200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares. For every three shares our employees buy (Investment Shares), Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years. The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions. In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES. As of 21 February 2019, awards for 291,657 NV and 219,423 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES. \\nNORTH AMERICAN SHARE PLANS \\nUnilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and the GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans. The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017, GSIP, MCIP and SHARES plans, respectively. However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws. The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States Inc. and they are governed by New York law. \\nThe foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified \\nin its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 (File No. 333-185299) filed with the SEC on 6 December 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference. \\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE \\nThe Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Boards. It also has responsibility for the cash and executive and all employee share-based incentive plans, the Remuneration Policy and performance evaluation of the Unilever Leadership Executive. \\nDIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT \\nFAMILY RELATIONSHIP \\nThere are no family relationships between any of our Executive Directors, members of the ULE or Non-Executive Directors. \\nOTHER ARRANGEMENTS \\nNone of our Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors or other key management personnel are elected or appointed under any arrangement \\nor understanding with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or others. \\n150 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 152}),\n",

NV ordinary shares mainly trade in the form of depositary receipts for shares.\\n \\nIn the United States, NV New York Registry Shares and PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank Trust\\n \\nCompany Americas (Deutsche Bank) acts for NV and PLC as issuer, transfer agent and, in respect of the PLC American Depositary Receipts, depositary.\\n \\nAt 21 February 2019 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), there were 4,134 registered holders of NV New York Registry Shares\\n \\nand 841 registered holders of PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States. We estimate that approximately 10% of NV’s ordinary shares\\n \\n(including shares underlying NV New York Registry shares) were held in the United States (approximately 11% in 2017) and approximately 11% of\\n \\nPLC’s ordinary shares (including shares underlying PLC American Depositary Receipts) were held in the United States (approximately 10% in 2017).\\n \\nNV and PLC are separate companies with separate stock exchange listings and different shareholders. Shareholders cannot convert or exchange \\nthe shares of one for shares of the other and the relative share prices on the various markets can, and do, fluctuate. Each NV ordinary share \\nrepresents the same underlying economic interest in the Unilever Group as each PLC ordinary share (save for exchange rate fluctuations).\\n \\nIf you are a shareholder of NV, you have an interest in a Dutch legal entity, your dividends will be paid in euros (converted into US dollars if you have\\n \\nshares registered in the United States) and you may be subject to tax in the Netherlands. If you are a shareholder of PLC, your interest is in a UK legal\\n entity, your dividends will be paid in sterling (converted into US dollars if you have American Depositary Receipts) and you may be subject to UK tax.\\n Nevertheless, the Equalisation Agreement means that as a shareholder of either company you effectively have an interest in the whole of Unilever.\\n On a going concern basis, you have largely equal rights over our combined net profit and capital reserves as shown in the consolidated accounts.\\n \\nTo Unilever’s knowledge, the Unilever Group is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation, any foreign government or by \\nany other legal or natural person, severally or jointly. The Group is not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at any subsequent \\ndate result in a change of control of Unilever.\\n \\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \\nTransactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and \\nassociates. Other than those disclosed in Notes 23 to 24 to the consolidated financial statements (and incorporated herein as above), there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2018 up to 21 February 2019 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). \\nDIVIDEND RECORD \\nThe following tables show the dividends declared and dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years, expressed in terms of the revised share denominations which became effective from 22 May 2006.

They are drafted to give a wide scope and provide that the primary objectives are: to carry on business as a holding company, to manage any companies in which it has an interest and to operate and carry into effect the Equalisation Agreement. At the 2010 PLC AGM, the shareholders agreed that the objects clause be removed from PLC’s Articles of Association so that there are no restrictions on its objects. \\nDIRECTORS’ BORROWING POWERS \\nThe borrowing powers of NV Directors on behalf of NV are not limited by NV’s Articles of Association. PLC Directors have the power to borrow on behalf of PLC up to three times the PLC proportion of the \\nadjusted capital and reserves of the Unilever Group, as defined in \\nPLC’s Articles of Association, without the approval of shareholders (by way of an ordinary resolution). \\nALLOCATION OF PROFITS \\nUnder NV’s Articles of Association, available profits after reserves have been provided for by virtue of law, the Equalisation Agreement or deemed necessary by the Board, are distributed first to 7% and 6% cumulative preference shareholders by a dividend of 7% and 6%, respectively, calculated on the basis of the original nominal value of 1,000 Dutch guilders converted to euros at the official conversion rate. The remaining profits are distributed to ordinary shareholders in proportion to the nominal value of their holdings. \\nDistributable profits of PLC are paid first at the rate of 5% per year on \\nthe paid-up nominal capital of 3\\n1/9p of the ordinary shares, in a further \\nsuch dividend at a rate of 5% per year on the paid-up nominal capital of 3\\n1/9p of the ordinary shares and then at the rate of 6% per year on \\nthe paid-up nominal capital of the deferred stock of £100,000. The \\nsurplus is paid by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares. \\nLAPSE OF DISTRIBUTIONS \\nThe right to cash and the proceeds of share distributions by NV lapses five and 20 years, respectively, after the first day the distribution was obtainable. Unclaimed amounts revert to NV. Any PLC dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date of the declaration of the dividend reverts to PLC. \\nREDEMPTION PROVISIONS AND CAPITAL CALL \\nUnder Dutch law, NV may only redeem treasury shares (including shares underlying depositary receipts) or shares whose terms permit redemption. Outstanding PLC ordinary shares and deferred shares cannot be redeemed. NV and PLC may make capital calls on money unpaid on shares and not payable on a fixed date. NV and PLC only issue fully paid shares. \\nMODIFICATION OF RIGHTS \\nModifications to NV’s or PLC’s Articles of Association must be \\napproved by a general meeting of shareholders. Any modification \\nof the NV Articles of Association that prejudices the rights of 7% or \\n6% cumulative preference shareholders of NV must be approved by \\nthree quarters of votes cast (excluding treasury shares) at a meeting \\nof affected holders. \\nModifications that prejudicially affect the rights and privileges of \\na class of PLC shareholders require the written consent of three \\nquarters of the affected holders (excluding treasury shares) or a \\nspecial resolution passed at a general meeting of the class at which at least two persons holding or representing at least one third of the \\npaid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) must be present.

US persons should \\nconsult their local tax advisers, particularly in connection with potential liability to pay US taxes on disposal, lifetime gift or bequest of their shares. A US person is a US individual citizen or resident, a corporation organised under the laws of the United States, or any other legal person subject to United States Federal Income Tax on its worldwide income. \\nTAXATION ON DIVIDENDS IN THE NETHERLANDS \\nAs of 1 January 2007, dividends paid by companies in the Netherlands \\nare in principle subject to dividend withholding tax of 15%. Where a shareholder is entitled to the benefits of the current Income Tax Convention (the Convention) concluded on 18 December 1992 between the United States and the Netherlands, when dividends are paid by NV to: • a corporation organised under the laws of the United States (or \\nany territory of it) having no permanent establishment in the Netherlands of which such shares form a part of the business property; or \\n• any other legal person subject to United States Federal Income \\nTax with respect to its worldwide income, having no permanent establishment in the Netherlands of which such shares form a part of the business property, these dividends qualify for a reduction of withholding tax on dividends in the Netherlands from 15% to 5%, if the beneficial owner is a company which directly holds at least 10% of the voting power of NV shares. \\nWhere a United States person has a permanent establishment in the \\nNetherlands, which has shares in NV forming part of its business \\nproperty, dividends it receives on those shares are included in that establishment’s profit. They are subject to income tax or corporation tax in the Netherlands, as appropriate, and tax on dividends in the \\nNetherlands will generally be applied at the full rate of 15% with, as \\nappropriate, the possibility to claim a credit for that tax on dividends \\nin the Netherlands against the income tax or corporation tax in the Netherlands. The net tax suffered may be treated as foreign income tax eligible for credit against shareholders’ United States \\nincome taxes. \\nThe Convention provides, subject to certain conditions, for a complete \\nexemption from, or refund of, Dutch dividend withholding tax if the beneficial owner is a qualified ‘Exempt Pension Trust’ as defined \\nin Article 35 of the Convention or a qualified ‘Exempt Organisation’ \\nas defined in Article 36 of the Convention. It is noted that, subject \\nto certain conditions, foreign (non-Dutch) tax exempt entities may \\nalso be entitled to a full refund of any Dutch dividend withholding tax suffered based on specific provisions in the Dividend Tax Act in the \\nNetherlands. This tax refund opportunity under Dutch domestic tax \\nlaw already applied to European Union and European Economic Area \\nentities as of 1 January 2007 and has been extended as of 1 January \\n2012 to all foreign tax exempt entities including, if appropriate, United States tax exempt entities. \\nUnder the Convention, qualifying United States organisations that are \\ngenerally exempt from United States taxes and that are constituted \\nand operated exclusively to administer or provide pension, retirement \\nor other employee benefits may be exempt at source from withholding \\ntax on dividends received from a Dutch corporation. A Competent \\nAuthority Agreement between the US and Dutch tax authorities on 6 \\nAugust 2007, published in the US as Announcement 2007-75, 2007-2 \\nCumulative Bulletin 540, as amended by a Competent Authority \\nAgreement published in the United States as Announcement 2010-26, \\n2010-1 Cumulative Bulletin 604, describes the eligibility of these US \\norganisations for benefits under the Convention and procedures for \\nclaiming these benefits.

Under the Convention, a United States trust, company or organisation \\nthat is operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, educational or public purposes is subject to an initial 15% withholding tax rate. Such an exempt organisation may be entitled to reclaim \\nfrom tax authorities in the Netherlands a refund of the Dutch dividend \\ntax, if and to the extent that it is exempt from United States Federal \\nIncome Tax and it would be exempt from tax in the Netherlands if it were organised and carried on all its activities there. If you are an NV shareholder resident in any country other than the United States or the \\nNetherlands, any exemption from, or reduction or refund of, dividend \\nwithholding tax in the Netherlands may be governed by specific \\nprovisions in Dutch tax law, the ‘Tax Regulation for the Kingdom of the Netherlands’, or by the tax convention or any other agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, if any, between the Netherlands and your country of residence. \\nUNITED STATES TAXATION ON DIVIDENDS \\nIf you are a United States person, the dividend (including the withheld amount) up to the amount of NV earnings and profits for United \\nStates Federal Income Tax purposes will be ordinary dividend income. \\nDividends received by an individual will be taxed at a maximum rate of \\n15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided \\nthe individual has held the shares for more than 60 days during the \\n121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, that \\nNV is a qualified foreign corporation and that certain other conditions \\nare satisfied. NV is a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. \\nIn addition, an additional tax of 3.8% will apply to dividends and other \\ninvestment income received by individuals with incomes exceeding \\ncertain thresholds. The dividends are not eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. \\nFor US foreign tax credit purposes, the dividend is foreign source \\nincome, and withholding tax in the Netherlands is a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against the shareholder’s United States \\nincome taxes. However, the rules governing the US foreign tax \\ncredit are complex, and additional limitations on the credit apply \\nto individuals receiving dividends eligible for the maximum tax rate \\non dividends described above. \\nAny portion of the dividend that exceeds NV’s United States earnings \\nand profits is subject to different rules. This portion is a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in NV’s shares, and thereafter \\nis treated as a gain on a disposition of the shares. \\nUnder a provision of the Dividend Tax Act in the Netherlands and \\nprovided certain conditions are satisfied, NV is entitled to a credit \\n(up to a maximum of 3% of the gross dividend from which dividend \\ntax is withheld) against the amount of dividend tax withheld before \\nremittance to tax authorities in the Netherlands. The United States tax authority may take the position that withholding tax in the Netherlands \\neligible for credit should be limited accordingly. \\nDISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR US INDIVIDUAL HOLDERS \\nUS individuals that hold certain specified foreign financial assets, \\nincluding stock in a foreign corporation, with values in excess of \\ncertain thresholds are required to file Form 8938 with their United \\nStates Federal Income Tax return.

An exception to this rule generally applies if you have a permanent establishment in the Netherlands and the capital gain is derived from the sale of shares which form part of that permanent establishment’s business property. \\nSUCCESSION DUTY AND GIFT TAXES IN THE NETHERLANDS \\nUnder the Estate and Inheritance Tax Convention between the United States and the Netherlands of 15 July 1969, individual US persons who are not Dutch citizens who have shares will generally not be \\nsubject to succession duty in the Netherlands on the individual’s death, \\nunless the shares are part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the Netherlands. \\nA gift of shares of a Dutch company by a person who is not a resident \\nor a deemed resident of the Netherlands is generally not subject to gift \\ntax in the Netherlands.

However, if you are either: • an individual who is not resident in the United Kingdom for the year \\nin question; or \\n• a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom when the \\ngain accrues \\nyou will generally not be liable to United Kingdom tax on any capital \\ngains made on disposal of your shares. \\nTwo exceptions are: if the shares are held in connection with a trade or \\nbusiness which is conducted in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment; or if the shares are held by an individual who becomes resident in the UK having left the UK for a period of non-residence of five years or less and who was resident for at least four of the seven tax years prior to leaving the UK. \\nUK INHERITANCE TAX \\nUnder the current estate and gift tax convention between the United \\nStates and the United Kingdom, ordinary shares held by an individual shareholder who is: • domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; \\nand \\n• is not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United \\nKingdom \\nwill generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax: • on the individual’s death; or • on a gift of the shares during the individual’s lifetime. \\nWhere ordinary shares are held on trust, they will generally not be \\nsubject to United Kingdom inheritance tax where the settlor at the time of the settlement: • was domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United \\nStates; and \\n• was not for the purposes of the convention a national of the \\nUnited Kingdom. \\nAn exception is if the shares are part of the business property of a \\npermanent establishment of the shareholder in the United Kingdom \\nor, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal \\nservices, pertain to a fixed base situated in the United Kingdom. \\nWhere ordinary shares are subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax \\nand United States federal gift or federal estate tax, the amount of the tax paid in one jurisdiction can generally be credited against the tax \\ndue in the other jurisdiction. \\nWhere a United Kingdom inheritance tax liability is prima facie not \\npayable by virtue of the convention, that tax can become payable if any applicable federal gift or federal estate tax on the shares in the United States is not paid. \\n154 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

Management believes that the COSO framework (2013) is a suitable framework for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting; \\n• Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2018, and has concluded that such \\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective. Management’s assessment and conclusion excludes Adityaa Milk, Equilibra, Betty Ice, Denny Ice, and Vegetarian Butcher from this assessment, as they were acquired on 27 September 2018, 1 October 2018, 1 November 2018, 3 December 2018, and 31 December 2018 respectively.

Underlying sales growth was 3.1% (2016: 3.7%), with a positive contribution from all categories. Underlying volume growth was 0.8% (2016: 0.9%) and underlying price growth was 2.3% (2016: 2.8%). Acquisitions and disposals had a favourable contribution of 0.9% (2016: 0.6%) reflecting acquisitions including Blueair, Living Proof and Carver Korea. Emerging markets contributed 58% of total turnover (2016: 57%) with underlying sales growth of 5.9% (2016: 6.5%) coming from price growth of 4.2% and volume growth of 1.6%. Developed markets underlying sales declined by 0.6% evenly balanced between price and volume. \\nUnderlying operating margin improved by 1.1 percentage points to \\n17.5%. Gross margin improved by 0.4 percentage points driven by positive mix and the roll-out of the ‘5-S’ savings programme that more than offset increases in commodity costs. The absolute level of brand and marketing investment was flat in local currencies versus 2016, as savings from advertising production were re-invested in increased media spend. As a percentage of turnover, brand and marketing investment was down by 0.6 percentage points. Overheads reduced by 0.1 percentage points, driven by a further reduction in the cost base partially offset by investment in capabilities including new business models and e-commerce. \\nOperating profit was up 13.5% to €8.9 billion (2016: €7.8 billion) \\nincluding €543 million of non-underlying items. Non-underlying items \\nwithin operating profit are €638 million restructuring costs, acquisition \\nand disposal-related costs of €159 million and one-off costs of €80 \\nmillion partly offset by gain on disposal of group companies of €334 \\nmillion. \\nNet finance costs increased by €314 million to €877 million (2016: \\n€563 million) as they included a one-off finance charge of €382 million relating to the book premium paid on the buyback of preference shares in Unilever N.V. The net cost of financing borrowings was €399 million, €70 million lower than 2016. The decrease was due to a lower average interest rate of 2.7% compared to 3.5% in 2016, and to lower other interest costs from one-off credits in Brazil. Pension financing was a charge of €96 million compared to €94 million in 2016. The effective tax rate was 20.8% versus 26.2% in 2016. The change was mainly due to the impact of US tax reform that led to a one-off tax benefit coming from restating deferred tax balances at the new lower federal tax rate, partially offset by the tax impact of the AdeS business \\ndisposal. \\nNet profit from joint ventures and associates was up 22% at €155 \\nmillion, an increase coming from growth in profits from the Pepsi \\nLipton joint venture and profit from disposal of an investment in \\na joint venture in India.

This measure excludes the post tax \\nimpact of non-underlying items. \\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON 2017 EXPENSES AND \\nOPERATING PROFIT \\nUnderlying operating profit increased by €0.8 billion compared to \\n2016 driven by an improvement across all divisions, with an increase in Beauty & Personal Care by €0.4 billion and Home Care and Foods and \\nRefreshment by €0.2 billion each. Operating profit increased by €1.1 \\nbillion, including a gain on disposal of AdeS Soy beverage business in \\nLatin America of €0.3 billion. \\nCost of raw and packing material and goods purchased for resale \\n(material costs) increased by €0.5 billion. This included a favourable exchange rate impact of €0.4 billion; at constant exchange rates it was up by €0.9 billion. At constant exchange rates, gross total input costs (including material costs, distribution and supply chain indirects) increase of €1.9 billion was more than offset by favourable price changes of €1.2 billion, and material costs savings of €1.4 billion during the year, resulting in gross margin improvement of 0.5 percentage points to 43.1%. \\nStaff costs increased by €0.2 billion despite a decrease in the average \\nnumber of employees, primarily due to share based compensation \\nand bonuses, which were higher due to stronger performance against \\ntargets as compared to 2016. There were also higher redundancy costs incurred during the year. These were partially offset by savings \\ndelivered through the C4G programme. The absolute level of our brand \\nand marketing investment in local currencies was flat versus 2016. At \\ncurrent rates, the brand and marketing investment as a percentage of \\nturnover was down by 0.6 percentage points to 14.1%. \\nThe impact of input costs and investment in our brands is discussed \\nfurther in our segmental disclosures, which also provide additional \\ndetails of the impact of brands, products and sub categories on driving \\ntop-line growth. \\n163 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 165}),\n",

Treasury processes are governed by standards approved by the Unilever Leadership Executive. Unilever manages a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity costs and liquidity. \\nOUTLOOK', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OUTLOOK \\nLooking forward, our priority is to accelerate quality growth. That means an investment-led approach based on delivering our 4G growth strategy – consistent growth, competitive growth, profitable growth and responsible growth, with an equal focus on each. In 2019 we expect market conditions to remain challenging. We anticipate underlying sales growth will be in the lower half of our multi-year 3-5% range, with continued improvement in underlying operating margin and another year of strong free cash flow. We remain on track for our 2020 goals. \\nOTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY \\nRAW MATERIALS \\nOur products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials which we source internationally and which may be subject to price volatility either directly or as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates. \\nIn 2018 we saw higher market inflation than in 2017 with price rises in \\ncrude-derived materials including plastic packaging and surfactants. \\nForeign exchange rates deteriorated over the second half of the \\nyear across most emerging markets, with significant impact from \\nArgentina, India, Brazil and Turkey. Looking ahead to 2019 we remain \\nwatchful for volatility in commodity and foreign exchange markets. \\nSEASONALITY \\nCertain of our businesses, such as ice cream, are subject to significant \\nseasonal fluctuations in sales. However, Unilever operates globally \\nin many different markets and product categories, and no individual \\nelement of seasonality is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole. \\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \\nWe have a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, and we conduct some of our operations under licences that are based on patents or trademarks owned or controlled by others. We are not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We use all appropriate efforts to protect our brands and technology. \\n166 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='COMPETITION \\nAs a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, we are competing \\nwith a diverse set of competitors. Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to competitors’. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance. \\nINFORMATION PRESENTED \\nUnless otherwise stated, share refers to value share. The market data and competitive set classifications are taken from independent industry sources in the markets in which Unilever operates. \\nIRAN-RELATED REQUIRED DISCLOSURE \\nUnilever operates in Iran through a non-US subsidiary. In 2018, sales in Iran were significantly less than one percent of Unilever’s worldwide turnover. During the year, this non-US subsidiary had approximately €1,528 in gross revenues and less than €382 in net profits attributable \\nto the sale of food, personal care and home care products to the Hotel \\nHoma Group, which is owned by the Social Security Organization of Iran, and IRR Mohammad Rasoullah Pharmacy, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We advertised our products \\non television networks that are owned by the Government of Iran or \\naffiliated entities. Income, payroll and other taxes, duties and fees \\n(including for utilities) were payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities in connection with our operations. Our non-US subsidiary maintains bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate our business in the country and make any required payments to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities. Our activities in Iran comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, including US and other international trade sanctions, and we plan to continue these activities. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \\nWe have interests in properties in most of the countries where there are Unilever operations. However, none are material in the context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used predominantly to house production and distribution activities and as offices. There is a mixture of leased and owned property throughout the Group. We are not aware of any environmental issues affecting the properties which would have a material impact upon the Group, and there are no material \\nencumbrances on our properties. Any difference between the market \\nvalue of properties held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in the balance sheet is not significant. We believe our existing facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group. \\n167 \\nUnilever  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Additional Information for US Listing Purposes', metadata={'source': '../docs/Unilever-Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2018.pdf', 'page': 169}),\n",
